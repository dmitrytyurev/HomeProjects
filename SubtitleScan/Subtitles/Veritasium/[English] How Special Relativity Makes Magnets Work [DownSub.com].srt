1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,979
Only a few elements can be permanent magnets
- iron is one.

2
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:08,900
Copper is not.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:17,480
But if you pass an electric current through
any metal it becomes a magnet - an electromagnet.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,740
But how does this work?

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,349
Well strangely enough, it's a consequence
of special relativity.

6
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:28,289
Special relativity is the fact that in our
universe, length and time aren't absolute;

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,050
they're perceived differently by observers
moving relative to each other (hence, "relativity").

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,480
For example, if you measure carefully enough,
you'll find that time passes slower for observers

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,210
moving relative to you.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,320
Hey Derek, when did you last shave?

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,820
Derek1: Six hours ago.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:49,620
MovingDerek: Actually it was five hours, 59
minutes and 59.99999999999 seconds

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,180
And moving objects are also contracted in
their direction of motion.

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,180
You're looking slim.

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,309
Only in your frame of reference.

16
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,460
So when an object is moving relative to you,
it actually takes up less space than when

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,530
it's not moving.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,630
And even though this effect is obviously way tinier than we've shown, length contraction

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,610
IS what makes an electromagnet work.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,370
Picture a copper wire - it consists of positive
metal ions swimming in a sea of free negative

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,510
electrons.

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,450
Now the number of protons is equal to the
number of negative electrons so overall the

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,810
wire is neutral.

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,360
So if there were a positive charged, err...
positively charged cat nearby, it would experience

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,610
no force from the wire on it at all.

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,350
And even if there were a current in the wire,
the electrons would just be drifting in one

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,150
direction, but the density of positive and
negative charges would still be the same,

28
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,650
and so the wire would be neutral, so no force
on the kitty.

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,580
But what if the cat starts moving?

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,530
Imagine for simplicity that that the cat is
moving in the same direction as the electrons

31
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,290
with the same velocity.

32
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,670
Well now in my frame of reference, the wire
is still neutral and so there should be no

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,650
force on the cat, but consider the same situation
in her frame of reference.

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,150
In the cat's frame of reference the positive
charges in the wire are moving, so according

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,790
to special relativity their separation will
be ever-so-slightly contracted.

36
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,679
Also, from this perspective the electrons
aren't moving so they'll be more spread out

37
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,940
than before - remember, objects take up more
space when they're not moving than when they

38
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
are.

39
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,080
These two changes together mean there's a
higher density of positive charges in the

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,500
wire, so it's no longer neutral - it's positively
charged!

41
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,470
Which means that the positively charged cat
will feel a repulsive electric force from

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,470
the wire.

43
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,880
But in my frame of reference this seems mysterious:
there's no force on a stationary charged cat,

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,670
but a moving cat is somehow repelled from
this neutral wire.

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,890
How do you account for this force?

46
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,550
Well we say it is the magnetic force, and
that's mainly because a wire with current

47
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,570
in it deflects nearby magnets.

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,810
So really, what this experiment shows is that
a magnetic field is just an electric field

49
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,140
viewed from a different frame of reference.

50
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,080
In the cat's frame of reference, it is repelled
from the wire due to the electric field created

51
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,280
by the excess positive charges produced by
the effects of length contraction.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,990
In MY frame of reference, the cat is repelled
from a neutral wire due to the magnetic field

53
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,790
generated by current flowing in the wire.

54
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,200
So whether you see it as an electric or a
magnetic field just depends on your frame

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,540
of reference, but in either case the results
are the same.

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,819
So an electromagnet is an everyday example
of special relativity in action.

57
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,110
Now that might seem crazy since electrons
drift through wires at about .0000000001%

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:30,930
the speed of light - so how can special relativity
have anything to do with it?

59
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,400
Well the truth is there are enough electrons
in a wire, and the electric interaction is

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,700
so amazingly strong that even the minuscule
effects of length contraction can produce

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,570
significant charge imbalances that produce
a noticeable force.

62
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,060
So special relativity explains electromagnets
- but what about permanent magnets?

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Yeah!

64
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,340
I mean there can't be electrical currents
flowing around inside lumps of rock, can there?
