1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,110
- There was a time when the universe was expanding
so rapidly that parts of it were moving apart

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,070
from each other faster than the speed of light.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,650
That time is right now.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,750
A lot of people make a big deal out of the
fact that during inflation, right after our

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,070
universe burst into existence, the whole universe
was expanding faster than light.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,430
Now, while that is true, it kind of implies
that the universe doesn't normally do that,

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,430
and it does.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,510
I mean, if you pick two points far enough
apart in our universe, you can always find

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,559
ones that are moving apart from each other
faster than light.

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,250
That is simply due to all of the expanding
space in between.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,329
So our universe is now and has always been
expanding faster than the speed of light.

12
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,680
But doesn't this violate Einstein's special
theory of relativity that says nothing should

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,809
be able to move faster than light?

14
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,790
Actually, no.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,519
Relativity says nothing can move through space
faster than light, but that doesn't stop space

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,170
itself from expanding however it likes.

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,659
Now, it was Hubble in the late 1920s who made
the observations of the night sky, which led

18
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,250
us to see that our universe is expanding.

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,680
The further out in space he looked, the faster
the objects were moving away from us.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,990
So imagine a point so far out there that the
average recession velocity is the speed of

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,990
light.

22
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,990
I mean, if you think about it, it's going
to be the same distance in every direction.

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,610
So that would form a sphere which we call
the Hubble Sphere.

24
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,090
Everything beyond that sphere is moving away
from us faster than the speed of light.

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,969
So common sense would say we would never be
able to see the light from those objects because

26
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:56,280
of how fast they're moving away from us.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,880
But in fact, this is not true.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,450
We can see those objects.

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,090
To understand how this could work, picture
a galaxy beyond our Hubble Sphere.

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,930
It's receding faster than light, it's in a
super luminal region of space from our perspective.

31
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,170
So any light that emits in our direction,
will actually be moving away from us as time

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,170
goes on.

33
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,459
Well that doesn't sound very promising.

34
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:29,459
But due to the accelerating expansion of space,
our Hubble Sphere is actually getting bigger.

35
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,140
And if it gets bigger faster than that light
can get away, then at some point that light

36
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,780
is going to travel from a super luminal region
of space into a subluminal region of space,

37
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,700
and so it can start making progress towards
us.

38
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,510
So we can detect it, so we can see that distant
galaxy, which is of course now even further

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,020
beyond our Hubble Sphere, but we can see its
light.

40
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,000
We can detect that it's there.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,890
This is remarkable.

42
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:05,269
In fact, all of the photons we now receive
from the first 5 billion years of the universe,

43
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:10,510
they were all emitted in regions of space
that were traveling, at the time, faster than

44
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,459
the speed of light relative to us.

45
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:18,780
The objects that emitted them were, are, and
always have been moving away from us faster

46
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,510
than the speed of light.

47
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,980
But their light has entered our Hubble Sphere
and had enough time to reach us, and so we

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,450
can see them.

49
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,060
So the observable universe is larger than
our Hubble Sphere.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,530
It's actually limited by what's called the
particle horizon.

51
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,640
That is based on the amount of time light
has had to travel towards us since the beginning

52
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,629
of time, that is 13.8 billion years ago as
far as we can tell.

53
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:50,280
Now because the universe has been expanding
and that expansion has been accelerating,

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,520
things are much further out than 13.8 billion
light years away.

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,519
I mean, the observable universe has a radius
of over 46 billion light years.

56
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,319
The diameter is about 93 billion light years.

57
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,239
That is a huge volume of things that we can
see.

58
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,659
And 13.8 billion years ago, everything in
that volume and everything beyond it that

59
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:20,510
we can't see would have been compressed into
a tiny infinitesimally small point that we

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,910
call the singularity.

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,870
Actually, no.

62
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,610
I mean, that would be true if the universe
is finite.

63
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:36,700
But if the universe is infinite, and it kind
of looks like it is, then it was always infinite.

64
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,970
So the big bang would have happened literally
everywhere.

65
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,270
But if the universe has always been infinite,
then what is it expanding into?

66
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,130
Well, it doesn't have to expand into anything.

67
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,170
I mean, it can expand into itself.

68
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,200
That's the thing about infinity.

69
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,420
You never run out of it.

70
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,580
This episode of Veritasium was supported by
audible.com, a leading provider of audiobooks

71
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,510
with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature,
including fiction, non-fiction, and periodicals.

72
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,540
This week I wanted to recommend the book Hitchhiker's
Guide To The Galaxy.

73
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,360
It's one of my favorites and it's a classic
of the science genre.

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,080
You know, people often ask me, why is the
number 42 on the Veritasium logo?

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,671
And that's because it's the answer to the
ultimate question of life, the universe, and

76
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:27,671
everything.

77
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,850
So if you haven't read this book yet, you
should definitely check it out, and in fact,

78
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,860
you can download it for free by going to audible.com/veritasium,
or you can pick any other book of your choosing

79
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,450
for a one month free trial.

80
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,400
So I want to thank Audible for supporting
me and I want to thank you for watching.
