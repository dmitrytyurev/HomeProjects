1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,400
Trees are some of the 
biggest organisms on the planet,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,360
but where do they get that matter to grow?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,440
Man: Rich nutrients out the ground.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,800
Man: Start with soil or in the air.

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,669
Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,900
Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil?

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,060
Man: Yeah...

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,340
Derek Muller: Yeah...

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,460
Derek Muller: Goodness.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,070
Man: Goodness.

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,850
Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole 
around the tree where it's taking out all the soil?

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,850
Man (right): 'Cause it does it so 
gradually that the soil is time to recover.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,660
Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,098
that the tree gets most of its mass from the

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,120
soil because you can see those roots
digging into the soil and they must be

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,219
taking something out of there and I mean
a tree looks like dirt and it feels

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,420
solid like dirt

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,180
but it's not.

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,340
In the early 1600 a scientist 
named Johann Baptist Van Helmholt

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,340
tried to figure out where the mass
of a tree was coming from

21
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,320
so he got a pot of soil and very carefully 
measured the amount of soil in there.

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
Then he planted the tree and  
took care of it for five years

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot .

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,860
At the end of this experiment

25
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,800
he was weighted the tree 
to find that it was 72 kilograms

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,860
but the massive soil had
only decreased by about 60 grams.

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,760
This was pretty strong evidence that the
mass of the tree does not come from the soil.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,560
I've never thought about that actually
because they don't really eat anything, trees.

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,940
They don't eat anything?
--No.

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,820
They don't eat anything?

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,120
Water, it's all basically absorbed.
--That's all they eat?

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,740
Yeah.
--They don't eat anything else?

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,720
No.
--That's all they eat.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,600
Well presumably from the water 
and the nutrients from the soil.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,760
Is there anything else that you need 
besides the soil and the water?

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,480
I suppose that's all you need, isn't it?

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,100
To make--
--Other than the original seed

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,880
for that particular tree, I suppose.

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,720
The seed, the soil, and the water and
that makes this big tree.

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,540
Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt
did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water.

41
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,220
Now while that's not correct 
at least he was on the right track

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,500
realizing that the matter of a tree 
doesn't  come out of the soil.

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
The sun energy, yeah.

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,100
The sun energy?
--Yeah.

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,300
Are they converting energy into mass or--?

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,180
Do you know what I mean?
--Yeah.

47
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,419
Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was.

48
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,860
Where did that stuff come from?

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,380
Magic.

50
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,960
[laughing]
I have no idea.

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,440
My question is where do they 
get that mass to grow big?

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,580
Sun.

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,460
Get it from the rain and the sun presuably.

54
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,960
Light.
--Sunlight.

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,320
The sunshine.
The sunshine?

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Does the sunshine add mass to the tree?

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,440
It would need sunshine to grow.

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,160
Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.
I don't know whether it adds mass,

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,760
but they wouldn't go without it.

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,459
Of course the sun's energy is needed for
the tree to build the matter into its

61
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,440
branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter.

62
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,560
Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well.

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,820
There's got to be something, you know.

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,120
What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well.

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,020
Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen?

66
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
And I guess oxygen.

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,860
The oxygen, of course.

68
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,940
The oxygen?

69
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Are there any ingredients that we're missing?

70
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,100
Carbon dioxide.

71
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:24,040
Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide.

72
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,020
Trees are largely made up of air.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah.
--Surprising.

74
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,380
I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh--

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,200
[laughing]

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,020
So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air,

77
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,300
out of the carbon dioxide that they take in.

78
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,740
What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,760
that's how we lose mass

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,680
but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass.

81
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,240
So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree.

82
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,440
You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in.

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,180
So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,800
and in a sense you're becoming the tree.
