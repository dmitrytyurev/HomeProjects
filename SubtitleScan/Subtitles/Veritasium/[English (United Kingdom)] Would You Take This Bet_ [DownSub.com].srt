1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,460
I want you to consider this bet. Here’s
ten dollars. This could be yours if I flip

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,759
this coin in the air, you guys call it in
the air. If you’re right I give you the

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:16,759
ten dollars. If you’re wrong you give me
ten dollars. I saw that coming. That’s not

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:24,580
a good bet for me. I guess in principle I don’t
agree with the idea of betting. Okay, okay.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:31,150
But what if we just use this as like an allegory
for life. You know, it’s not really about

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,899
money and betting on a coin, it’s more about
our approach to risk. Okay, and my approach

7
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,019
to risk is obviously a lot less than yours.
You wouldn’t do this bet? No, no. No, I

8
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,579
don’t have ten bucks. My gut says don’t
bet. Why is that? Because at the moment I

9
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,629
have ten dollars and later I might not. So
people are passing up the opportunity to win

10
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,390
ten dollars of my money. But it kind of makes
sense because they have to risk ten dollars

11
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,850
of their money and it’s a 50/50 chance,
so really the bet has zero value. What if

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,840
I sweeten the deal? What if I put up twelve
dollars to your ten? You only stand to lose

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,479
ten. You stand to gain twelve. How’s that
sound? I wouldn’t. I still wouldn’t bet.

14
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,750
I feel like I’m better off just leaving
it as it is. I’ll offer you 15 dollars.

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,170
You only have to put up 10. I’m putting
up 15. No. I’m offering you an extra five

16
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,350
dollars. Why not? I’m not giving my 10 dollars
away. What about 20? That’s as high as I’m

17
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,750
going today. Twenty dollars that is the top.
It’s two to one. I just don’t like taking

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,350
that much risk. You don’t like risking ten
bucks? Sure. I’m valuing my 10 dollars,

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,310
I am. But why don’t you value my 20 dollars
which you’ve got a 50 percent chance of right

20
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,229
here if you accept the bet. I don’t know.
I can’t tell you. It’s not like a, I don’t

21
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,509
know what the logical reason is for why I
want that. I don’t know. I can’t be, I

22
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,939
just feel it’s not right. Now this does’t
make sense. I’ve offered people up to 20

23
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:04,469
dollars and they’re still refusing to take
the bet. Well the bet is objectively in their

24
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,818
favor. I mean a 50% of winning 20 plus a 50%
chance of losing 10 still gives the bet an

25
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:17,060
overall value of 5 dollars. Why is it that
you won’t go for this bet? I don’t know.

26
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,450
Because I don’t want to lose 10 dollars
just because of that easily. I know but you

27
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,709
could win twenty dollars. Think about the
gain. Well, I don’t know. I’m thinking

28
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:32,269
more about what I lose than what I win. I
think. I think that’s exactly the point.

29
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,209
Because we feel losses more than we feel gains.
There’s an asymmetry in the way people perceive

30
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,440
gains and losses. Losses are felt much more
intensely. In fact psychology most people

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,940
weight a loss around twice as heavily as a
gain. But this varies from person to person.

32
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,670
What if I go to 30 dollars? I said, even if
you had 50 I would still feel the same way.

33
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,780
Fifty dollars to 10 dollars that would be
a reasonable. That’s when you would say

34
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,650
yes? Possibly, yes. You’re gonna have to
give me like a hundred. But I lose ten. This

35
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,959
is known as loss aversion. To avoid risking
a loss, people will pass up even very favorable

36
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,790
bets. But is there a way to overcome our oversensitivity
to losses? Let me ask you this. What if I

37
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,340
offered to do this ten times in a row? Same
deal, 20 dollars for your ten, flipping this

38
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,390
coin? But then I would be losing 10 dollars
each time wouldn’t I? You might be, you’d

39
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,519
be risking 10 dollars each time, but you know
that this is 50/50 and you know that I’m

40
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,360
giving you ten chances. Is that a better deal,
to do it repeatedly? I don’t think so. What

41
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
about a hundred times? I don’t think so.
It doesn’t get better? No. If we played

42
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,000
enough and I had enough of you know of a stake
of 10 dollars then eventually yes I would

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,989
make more money yes. So why does repeating
the same bet change it? I don’t think there’s

44
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,409
a rational thought behind it, it’s just
a feeling that one gets when presented with

45
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:57,439
the opportunity. I don’t know. I think there
is a rational reason behind it. Is it? Yeah.

46
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,640
Because the coin is going to be 50/50. You
don’t know on one toss, you’re only going

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,689
to get one outcome. But in a hundred tosses,
you know that it’s going to be somewhere

48
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:12,090
between like 45 and 55 times it’s going
to go your way, 45 to 55 times it’s going

49
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,000
to go my way. Right? The point is, every time
it goes your way, you win twice as much as

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,970
you lose when it goes my way. So the point
is, doing it a hundred times you’re basically

51
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,870
guaranteed to win money. More chances. No
no, it’s not more chances of winning, it

52
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,090
is you are guaranteed to win money. In fact,
the expected value of a hundred of these bets

53
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:37,560
is a win of 500 dollars. And there’s only
a one in 2300 chance of losing any money at

54
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,360
all. So even if you weight losses twice as
much as gains, a hundred bets is indisputably

55
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,190
favorable. So here’s the thing, how do you
accept a hundred of these bets if you won’t

56
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,100
first accept one of those bets? This experiment
is not about gambling. It’s not to encourage

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,650
you to go to the casino where the odds are
definitely stacked against you. Instead, it

58
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,949
is a metaphor for all the little risks and
opportunities that come our way in our lives.

59
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:11,380
I mean if you view each one as an independent
event, you will often say no to even very

60
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,380
good bets because you’re afraid of the loss.
So if instead you can see each little bet

61
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,270
as one of a series of bets, then you realize
that if you take that bet every time you may

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,840
win and you may lose, but overall on the aggregate,
you will come out ahead. Heads. Heads it is.

63
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:43,350
He’s just won himself 12 bucks. Tails. The
ten bucks is your sir. Heads. Thank you very

64
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:50,699
much. The man has won 20 bucks. See, it pays
to take the risk. Yay! Yes! This is unbelievable.

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,400
My stroke of luck today has been terrible.
Every has won off me so far. Who’s funding

66
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,660
you? I’m funding myself. That’s honestly
my money. Really? Yeah. This video is in fact

67
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,979
a bit of a risk for me. Because I’m giving
out all this money and it’s only going to

68
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,910
make money on YouTube if like half a million
people see it. So if you like this video,

69
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,349
then you should share it with your friends
so that this actually turns out to be a positive

70
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:20,349
bet for me. Okay I’ll do that. Yeah. Share
it with your friends. It’s Veritasium. That’s

71
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,680
the name of the website. Veritasium. So would
you take this one-off bet? Let me know in

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,530
the comments below and tell me know how much
money I would have to put up for you to risk

73
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,030
your ten dollars. Now this video was inspired
by the book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel

74
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,849
Kahneman which I’ve recommended before because
it’s awesome and it also inspired me to

75
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:44,660
make these cool videos so check them out if
you haven’t already. But since I’ve recommended

76
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,990
this book before I’m going to recommend
something different today. My friend Phil

77
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,729
Plait’s book Bad Astronomy which is all about misconceptions and misuses of astronomy from astrology through to the moon landing hoaxes. It is an awesome book so you should

79
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,310
definitely check it out and in fact you can
download it for free by going to audible.com/Veritasium.

80
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,520
Or you can pick any other book of your choosing
for a one month free trial. Audible is a great

81
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,789
audiobook website with over 150,000 titles
in all areas of literature including fiction,

82
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:16,020
nonfiction and periodicals. So I really want
to thank audible for supporting me and I want

83
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,340
to thank you for watching.
