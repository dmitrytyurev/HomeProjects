1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,550
I am going to scream as loud as I can and
I am going to keep screaming as loud as I

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,110
can while I spin around. I will keep going
until my breath runs out.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,160
>> Great.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,300
>> You ready? >> Yeah.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,480
>> Ok [Screams]

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,580
>> That was outstanding. Thank you.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,440
>> Thank you.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,890
>> The quietest place on earth is apparently
an anechoic chamber in Minneapolis. Now I

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,320
am here at BYU at their anechoic chamber.
Anechoic is Latin and basically means no echo.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,010
And the way they achieve no echo is through all of these foam wedges which are put on the wall and even the floor.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,050
and even the floor. You can see
that I am actually on a spring floor and down

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,780
below me there are all of these wedges.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,379
Now you may want to use headphones while you
are listening to this video, because that

14
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,999
is going to be quite important.

15
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:54,489
>> Low frequency sound will come in and, by
the shape of it, bounce and just keep bouncing

16
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,850
pretty much forever until it just gets lost
in the wall. And then high frequencies are

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,839
more so going to get absorbed into the foam
itself.

18
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:07,559
>> You can hear how the room deadens echoes
by clapping constantly while closing the doors.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:27,760
[Clapping]

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,840
It totally changes the quality of the sound.
>> Definitely.

21
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,240
>> There are reports that it is impossible
to stay in one of these rooms and remain sane

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,810
for a significant period of time. The record
is apparently 45 minutes.

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,650
>> I felt a little claustrophobic. And yet, it
felt like there is a lot of pressure on my

24
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,770
head.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,980
>> But why would that be? I mean, the air
is no different in here.

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,340
>> What I figured is just because when you
listen in a normal room there is a lot of

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,800
reverb. To your ear that means there is a
lot of space, but there is none of that in

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,620
here, so it feels claustrophobic.

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,830
>> It feels like you are in a tiny room, like
you could be in a coffin.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,290
>>Yeah, maybe, yeah.

31
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,280
>> I think it is really an anxiety response.
So you are used to having these sounds around

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,230
you and then you don’t anymore and so you
start to panic, because you don’t have something

33
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,090
you are used to, and I think that anxiety can
increase, cause some stress, and maybe that's

34
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,350
why people go crazy or hallucinate with
sound. It is just because they are trying

35
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,350
to make up for what they are used to that
isn’t there.

36
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,230
>> When I bring people in I warn them: Hey,
if you get a little dizzy, please let me know,

37
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,390
so I can get you out of the room before you
make a mess in our expensive facilities.

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,560
>> First you will hear any rustle of your
clothing. So you move an inch and you will

39
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,920
hear it. Then you will hear any fluids that
are in your mouth or your throat. You'll

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,520
hear them all moving around every time you
move your mouth. And the longer you stay there

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,650
the more you will hear. So you will start
to hear the blood flow through your brain.

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,630
>> Have you heard it?

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,930
>> Yeah. It sounds kind of like a ringing
or a pulsing.

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,770
>> Can you kind of make the sound for us so
that we know what to listen in for?

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,400
>> Of the blood flow? >> Yeah, like...

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,160
>> It just sounds like a pulsing, like, shh,
shh, shh.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,120
Some people say they can hear their heart
beat coming from their chest as well.

48
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,750
>> Have you heard that?

49
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,410
>> No.

50
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,699
>> A violinist placed in one of these rooms
was apparently banging on the door within a matter

51
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,000
of seconds trying to get out. Now
that people say it's impossible to stand up

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,900
because you become so disoriented, dizzy, nauseous. And some people even hear oral hallucinations.

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,330
But to me it doesn’t sound right. You know,
I believe that I should be able to sit in

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,970
a room with no sound with the lights off for
as long as I like. And so I am going to put

55
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,090
myself to the test by staying in this room
for as long as I can.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,640
>> Have fun in silence.

57
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,580
>> Thank you.

58
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,650
Now it is just me in the anechoic chamber.
And this is probably the quietest place I

59
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,770
have ever been. And in a second I will tell the
guys, shut the lights off.

60
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,540
Ok, I think...

61
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,220
Oh. I am ready.

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,140
And the lights are off. I'm going 
to turn off the camera so I don’t

63
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,530
have this light and then there is only the
audio recorder that I will keep with me.

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm not sure how long I have been in here,
but I still feel quite comfortable.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,120
It's nice and quiet. I mean, that is an understatement.
But it's relaxing.

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,320
If I hear anything, I feel like I hear a low pitched hum.

67
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,680
If I have to guess as to how long I have been
in here I would say about eight minutes.

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,040
I feel like I am more aware of my heart. I
can feel each pulse, and I can almost feel

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,160
it radiating up my chest towards my head,

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
like a wave.

71
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,340
And in my ears there's a hiss. 
I think that is just...

72
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
from hearing loss.

73
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,600
This just reminds me of that Mission Impossible
movie where Tom Cruise sneaks into that building

74
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,800
and he has to keep his decibel level low.

75
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
[Quiet burp]

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,160
That was a burp. I don’t know if you could
hear that.

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:18,919
I can say the really small sounds seem amplified.
It is like your brain has recalibrated, so

78
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,019
the quiet things seem much louder.

79
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,820
I feel like I can feel more things like...

80
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,160
with every beat of my heart it feels like...

81
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,220
my body shakes a little bit...

82
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,960
like a device that has
a little motor inside of it. How it gets shook around

83
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,550
like a thumb.

84
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,259
Ok, Cameron, looks to me like we are good
for time. If it looks the same to you like

85
00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:02,720
we are around 46 minutes or over, I am happy
to hop out. So, yeah, when you are ready you

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,280
could flip the lights back on if you like.
Are you there?

87
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,600
Hello?

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,440
I think I have been in here for nearly
an hour according to my time checks. And I

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,350
didn’t fall asleep, I just, you know,
I have had a good time. It is a nice quiet

90
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,020
space. I kind of feel like this would be a
good material to pad your bedroom in. Not

91
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,610
a problem. Anechoic chamber, 45 minutes, an
hour. Easy. I could stay in here for five

92
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,490
hours. I think I could get a lot of work done
in here.

93
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:48,470
So now I just have to get out. And I am going
to see if I can exit this room without them

94
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,620
turning the lights on.

95
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,700
Even the doors are nice and quiet. There we are.
Back to the outside world.

96
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,980
Hello, how are you doing?
>> You alive? >> I am.

97
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:35,940
I don't really understand how anyone could go crazy in there. I mean, quiet is kind of nice. But then again

98
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,860
there are people who find all sorts of situations
really uncomfortable like just being in pitch

99
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,170
black room or being in a small confined space.
So maybe those types of people would find

100
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,920
this kind of unnerving.

101
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,790
I definitely noticed that there were a lot
of noises. Like it wasn’t just pure silence.

102
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,660
Like I actually have to work hard to make
things feel silent. Otherwise, you know, there

103
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,880
was the sound of like me just rubbing my beard
or just like the rustle of your clothes or

104
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,060
every time you swallow or you breathe. Perhaps
the weirdest thing I noticed was like my sense

105
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:16,260
of my heart. I just felt like it was pumping
really hard, and I could feel almost like the

106
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,440
blood pushing up through me. It wasn’t like
I was hearing it. It was just like I was feeling

107
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,540
it. And I was feeling it as though, in a way,
my heart

108
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,120
was shaking my body.

109
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
That was something weird.

110
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,160
But besides that, nothing crazy, no weird hallucinations
or anything like that.

111
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:42,100
So I think the myth that you can’t stay
in here for longer than 45 minutes is busted,

112
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,420
even though this is not Myth Busters. I still
think it is not true.

113
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,310
Now if you really hate silence, you should
always carry an audio book around with you.

114
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,370
And I can recommend a good one: The Fault
in our Stars by my friend John Green. It is

115
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,040
an excellent book and it has been basically
the talk of the best sellers ever since it

116
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,660
was released. And soon there is a movie coming
out and so you probably want to get through

117
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,570
the book before you go and see the movie.
Now you can download this book for free by

118
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,220
going to Audible.com/Veritasium. Or you could
pick any other book of your choosing for a

119
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,010
one month free trial. Audible is an amazing
site with over 150,000 titles in all areas

120
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,510
of literature including fiction, non-fiction,
and periodicals. So you should check them

121
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,240
out. The link is in the doobly-doo, as John would say.

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,540
So I would like to thank Audible for supporting
me and I would like to thank you for watching.
