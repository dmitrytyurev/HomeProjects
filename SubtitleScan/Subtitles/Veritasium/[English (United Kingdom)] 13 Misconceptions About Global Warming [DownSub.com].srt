1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,730
Let's talk about the science of climate change.
Don't you mean Global Warming?

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,830
How'd you get in here?
I'm the Internet, I never left. Now why'd

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,600
you change the name? Global warming wasn't
happening so you had to call it "Climate Change"?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,140
The overall average temperature of the planet
is increasing so Global Warming is technically

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,109
correct, but that doesn't mean it's going
to be warmer everywhere all the time.

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,300
And that leads to some confusion, like on
a cold winter's day, you might say...

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,929
So much for global warming!
Exactly.

8
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,940
So the term climate change indicates that
the problem is more intense storms, droughts

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,930
and floods, ocean acidification, not just
that the globe is warming.

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,870
But it's not.
What?

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,820
The globe's not warming.
Since when?

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,719
1995
Um, that's not how you draw a trendline through

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,539
data.
If the slope is nil, the climate's chill.

14
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,719
Y'know thirteen of the fourteen hottest years
occurred this century and the graph you're

15
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,620
using is old, it doesn't include satellite
data. If you take that into a count, the trend

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,480
is obviously continuing upwards.
Oh, so now you say it's warming. In the past

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,180
scientists told us it was cooling. Why can't
they just admit that they have no idea what's

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,260
going on?
It's true in the 1970's there were some papers

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,820
published predicting cooling, but over that
same time period there were six times as many

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,090
papers predicting warming. So scientists really
haven't changed their tune.

21
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,550
Well just judging by temperatures, I say they're
wrong. The Earth is cooling.

22
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,220
But you don't just have to go by temperatures.
There are plenty of other signs that the globe

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,900
is warming, like sea levels are rising three
millimetres a year. That's an indication that

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,390
the oceans are getting warmer and so are expanding.
Ice on Antarctica and Greenland is melting

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,630
at unprecedented rates and arctic sea ice
continues to decline.

26
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,860
Nuh-uh. Arctic sea ice increased forty percent
in the last two years.

27
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,910
That last little uptick? That's what you focus
on? What about the general downward trend?

28
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,190
It could mean anything. You know if the Earth
is warming the most likely source of the problem

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,220
is the sun. The sun is getting brighter. Did
you ever think of that?

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,099
The sun was getting brighter, in the 1930's,
and it probably contributed to some warming

31
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,459
then. But since the 50's the sun has been
getting dimmer and temperatures continue to

32
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,010
rise.
Oh, so you automatically assume it's man-made

33
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,569
CO2.
You know humans only emit a tiny fraction

34
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,430
of the CO2 released into the atmosphere every
year.

35
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,180
That's true. People emit about 30 gigatonnes
compared with 780 gigatonnes from natural

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,180
land and ocean processes.
So you admit it, humans aren't the problem.

37
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,540
No! Before us the system was in balance with
the land and oceans absorbing that same amount

38
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,310
- 780 gigatonnes a year.
This balance kept the carbon dioxide levels

39
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,969
in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 part
per million for 800,000 years. Now it's at

40
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:57,209
400 parts per million and still rising.
But our small contribution couldn't have caused

41
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,810
that.
Well the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is

42
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,959
increasing by about fifteen gigatonnes or
two parts per million every year.

43
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,689
But how do you know that's man-made CO2?
Because the isotope carbon-13 is less common

44
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,780
in fossil fuels than it is naturally in the
atmosphere. And over time we're seeing the

45
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,060
concentrations of carbon-13 are decreasing.
But volcanoes emit way more CO2 than humans.

46
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,999
No they don't. They emit about 0.25 gigatonnes
annually. That's less than one percent as

47
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,609
much as humans.
OK, well even if we are responsible for the

48
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,389
rise in CO2, it doesn't matter because water
is by far the most potent greenhouse gas.

49
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,569
Yes it is.
I win.

50
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:41,029
No you don't!
Water in the atmosphere is increasing as well.

51
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:44,799
But that can't be due to human activity.
The only way for the atmosphere to hold more

52
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,529
water vapour is if it gets warmer. So...
Hang on, you're not saying...

53
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:56,689
Yes! It all comes back to CO2. A doubling
of CO2 on its own would increase the temperature

54
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:01,870
of the globe by one degree Celsius. But that
warming means there will be more water vapour

55
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,029
in the atmosphere and ice will melt reducing
the reflectivity of Earth's surface. So it's

56
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:11,669
a positive feedback loop, which a bunch of
different sources of evidence all indicate

57
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,430
will lead to about a 3 degree Celsius rise
in temperature.

58
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,959
But if this is true, why have all the predictions
failed. In actuality most of the predictions

59
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,220
show remarkable agreement with observations.
But you're probably thinking of the model

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,720
from 1988, back when we thought climate sensitivity
was higher. If you re-run that model with

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,860
3 degrees of warming for every doubling of
CO2, the predictions match exactly the warming

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,630
that we've observed.
But the Earth has warmed and cooled in the

63
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:44,150
past. So who was releasing CO2 then, aliens?
We understand that past changes in the climate

64
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,340
were triggered at regular intervals by Milankovitch
cycles, that is the periodic oscillation of

65
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,460
the Earth's tilt, precession of the tilt,
and stretching and squishing of Earth's elliptical

66
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,800
orbit.
During every warming cycle, CO2 and temperature

67
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,290
rise together.
Ah, but if you look closely at that graph,

68
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,050
you'll see that CO2 lags behind the temperature
rise, so it can't be causing the warming.

69
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,970
The CO2 doesn't cause the first warming. The
Milankovitch cycles change the way the sunlight

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,190
hits the Earth and that causes a little bit
of warming decreasing the solubility of CO2

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,880
in the oceans. So some of that CO2 is released
and that is a positive feedback loop, which

72
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,010
amplifies the warming. In fact over 90% of
the increase happens after the CO2 starts

73
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,000
to rise.
Let's say you're right, and the CO2 we're

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,540
releasing is warming the planet. What's so
bad about that? The planet gets a little warmer,

75
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,670
big deal.
I'm not claiming it's going to be some sort

76
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,130
of crazy catastrophe, but we are going to
get more intense storms, more droughts and

77
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,530
floods, the oceans will become more acidic,
sea levels will rise and my point is it would

78
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,440
be better for all species on this planet and
probably cheaper for us if we just started

79
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,570
reducing emissions now than if we wait and
pay the consequences later.

80
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,570
No thanks.
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

81
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,740
Global warming.

like how cigarettes cause lung cancer, or
how CFC's cause the ozone hole, or now how

86
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,760
CO2 is causing the planet to warm. So if you
