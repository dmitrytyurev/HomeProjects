00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,070
- [Derek] The modern era of electronics

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,970
began with the light bulb

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,963
but not in the way you might think.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,290
Early light bulbs consisted
of a carbon filament

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,851
sealed inside a glass bulb

6
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:14,040
with a vacuum inside.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,830
When a potential difference was
applied across the filament,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,510
current flowed through it,

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,210
heating it up to over 2000 Kelvin,

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,430
so hot that it glowed.

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,620
If there had been much oxygen in the bulb,

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,140
the filament would've burned immediately.

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,630
That was the reason for the vacuum.

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,790
But from the perspective of electronics,

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,580
the real breakthrough came
from a curious observation

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,413
made by Thomas Edison.

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,512
He saw that over a bulb's lifetime,

18
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,200
the glass became discolored,

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
turning yellow, and then brown,

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,360
but only on one side.

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,283
So what was going on?

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,840
Well, the heated filament
emits not only light and heat

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,000
but also electrons.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,524
You can think of them being
boiled off the surface

25
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:01,290
of the carbon.

26
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,019
This phenomenon, known
as thermionic emission,

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,090
had twice been discovered independently

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,390
by other scientists up
to 27 years earlier.

29
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,020
But after Edison, it became widely known.

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,070
In fact, for a time,

31
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,290
the emission of electrons
off a hot filament

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,990
was called the Edison effect.

33
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,923
Now, these electrons floating
around were unobstructed

34
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:24,210
because they're in a vacuum.

35
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,950
But since there was a potential difference

36
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,990
across the wires that led to the filament,

37
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,380
the electrons were attracted
to the positive wire.

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,690
So they accelerated towards it

39
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,773
and most would whizz straight past it

40
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:38,010
and crash into the glass,

41
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,810
over time discoloring it
only on the positive side.

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,258
I should note that Edison
was using DC electricity.

43
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:47,460
If he had been using AC,

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,580
then both sides would've been discolored.

45
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,040
But it was this observation
that set the scene

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,810
for an electronics revolution,

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,173
and eventually the
first digital computers.

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,768
In 1904, John Ambrose
Fleming patented a device

49
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,700
that was very similar
to Edison's light bulb,

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,220
but with one important addition:

51
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,979
a second electrode in the bulb.

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,661
By charging this plate positively

53
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,310
with respect to the filament,

54
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,890
electrons could be
accelerated across the gap,

55
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,600
completing the circuit.

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,430
But if the plate were slightly negative

57
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,660
relative to the filament,

58
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,220
then it would repel electrons

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,380
and no current would flow.

60
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,460
Fleming called his device a
one-way street for electricity.

61
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,920
Since only one of the
electrodes was heated,

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,770
electrons could only flow
from there to the plate

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,110
and not the other way around.

64
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,840
The device was called a thermionic diode

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,320
and it was used initially
for detecting radio signals

66
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,700
but it could also convert

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,223
alternating current to direct current.

68
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,180
Scientists quickly realized
that a more efficient design

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,502
had the filament in the center

70
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:54,962
and the other electrode
to the plate or anode

71
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:57,480
as a cylinder surrounding it.

72
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,713
This geometry captured
more of the electrons

73
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,140
coming off the filament

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,693
and allowed for larger currents to flow.

75
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:09,270
-  Oh, there she goes.

76
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,890
- [Derek] With just one of these diodes,

77
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,240
you could convert AC
into a bumpy kind of DC.

78
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,260
But combining a few diodes and a capacitor

79
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,030
led to a fairly steady direct current,

80
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,590
and this was a big deal.

81
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,440
It was the first practical
vacuum tube device

82
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,660
and the model for all vacuum tubes

83
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,890
that would dominate the industry

84
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,453
for the next half century.

85
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,740
In the early 1900s,

86
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,890
the big problem in
electronics was amplification.

87
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,690
Radio had just been invented

88
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,100
but its range was limited

89
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,840
by the lack of reliable equipment

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,940
that could boost weak signals.

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,040
Similarly, telephone calls were limited

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,680
to at most 1300 kilometers

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,850
because by that point,

94
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,544
the signal was two faint to hear.

95
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:55,941
Rudimentary form of
amplification had been built

96
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:59,400
for telegraph operation called the relay.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,980
In a relay, there is an electromagnet.

98
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,380
And when current flows
through that electromagnet,

99
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,180
it attracts a switch,

100
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,340
turning on a second circuit.

101
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,470
But when the current through
the electromagnet stops,

102
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,820
the switch is released

103
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,400
and the second circuit is open again.

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,350
This device works well for amplifying

105
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,709
the dots and dashes of Morse
code along a telegraph line

106
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,929
but its binary output means it's incapable

107
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,983
of amplifying the complex
and analog signals

108
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:27,573
of phone calls and radio waves.

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,530
And that's why it was such
a breakthrough in 1906

110
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,720
when Lee de Forest took the diode

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,750
and added another electrode into the bulb.

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,630
This electrode wasn't
a solid piece of metal

113
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,240
but rather a sparse wire mesh

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,660
and it was positioned in
between the filament or cathode

115
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,280
and the anode.

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,910
With three electrodes,
it was called a triode.

117
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,250
Now, a large potential
difference could be applied

118
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,380
across the anode and cathode

119
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,520
but the number of electrons

120
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,560
that actually flowed between them

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,350
was controlled by the voltage on the grid,

122
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,600
as this new electrode was known.

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,760
If the grid were slightly
negatively charged,

124
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,890
it repelled electrons from the filament

125
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,290
so that none could flow
through to the anode.

126
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,300
But if the grid were slightly positive,

127
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,480
then electrons were attracted
away from the filament

128
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,030
and most of them would pass
through the holes in the grid,

129
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,580
and then accelerate to the anode.

130
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,300
So in this way, a small
change in voltage on the grid

131
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,540
can control a huge voltage at the anode

132
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,040
and the response is rapid.

133
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,520
So you can get high
frequency amplification.

134
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,630
I like to think of it

135
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,180
as standing at the top of a high cliff,

136
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,630
opening and closing a valve on a big water pipe.

137
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,690
I mean, it doesn't take much
energy to turn the valve

138
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,542
but that small input is converted

139
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:49,113
into a huge output of water
falling down the cliff.

140
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,299
- [Derek] You're powering
up this track here.

141
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,510
- [David] Warming up, you
can see it warming up there.

142
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,062
- [Derek] So the yellow is the input?

143
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,360
- [David] Yellow is the input.

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,620
Purple is the output.

145
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,247
We have essentially a two-volt change

146
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,250
on the input giving us, what is this?

147
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,360
Five volts, so five, 10,
15-volt change on the output.

148
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,680
- [Derek] For this demonstration,

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,290
we were only using 24 volts on the anode.

150
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,820
If we had used a higher voltage,

151
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,520
we could have got a lot more amplification

152
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,650
and people did.

153
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,660
This was the device that allowed us

154
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,390
to call long distance for the first time.

155
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,440
Using vacuum tubes,

156
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,972
the first transcontinental call

157
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:25,830
from New York to San Francisco

158
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,433
took place on the 25th of January, 1915.

159
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,000
- [Derek] Whoa.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,290
- [David] Yeah, there we go,

161
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,090
should be 10 volts.

162
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,736
- [Derek] It's hard to see the grid here

163
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,980
because just like with
the cylindrical diode,

164
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,488
the best configuration for a triode

165
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:45,120
is to have a cylindrical configuration.

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,378
The anode is on the outside,

167
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,361
the grid is cylindrically inside that,

168
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:51,483
and the cathode or
filament is in the center.

169
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,140
The invention of the triode
was incredibly important.

170
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,830
Radios, TVs, whatever
electronics people had

171
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,810
were powered by vacuum tubes.

172
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,730
You would've had so many in your house

173
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,760
even up until the 1960s and '70s.

174
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,303
But vacuum tubes weren't done
revolutionizing electronics.

175
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,630
In his 1937 thesis,

176
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,810
Claude Shannon found a connection
between electric circuits

177
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,410
and a branch of mathematics
known as Boolean algebra.

178
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,390
Working in the mid-1800s,

179
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,340
George Boole was trying to find

180
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,710
a mathematical foundation for logic.

181
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,730
Under his system,

182
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,320
a true statement was represented

183
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,380
as a 1 and a false statement as a 0.

184
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,340
And Boole also developed
a few operations like AND.

185
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,423
If both statements A and B were true,

186
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,143
then the output would also be true.

187
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,920
What Shannon realized is
that Boole's operations

188
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,620
could be represented
as electronic circuits,

189
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,090
that there was an equivalence

190
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,190
between mathematical statements

191
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,990
and electric circuits.

192
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,110
All you needed to realize these
circuits in the real world

193
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,823
were a couple switches.

194
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,820
That same year, 1937,

195
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,910
George Stibitz built the
first digital calculator.

196
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,330
It could add two 1-bit binary numbers.

197
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,250
That is it could add two numbers

198
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,070
so long as they were either 0 or 1.

199
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,500
The calculator worked using a relay,

200
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
that electromechanical
switch from telegraphy.

201
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,880
There were two inputs.

202
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,520
If they were left open, the input was 0.

203
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,770
If closed, it was a 1.

204
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,283
The output was shown with two light bulbs.

205
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:26,970
If no lights were on,

206
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,260
the answer was 0.

207
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,730
If the output light was on,

208
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,810
the answer was 1.

209
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,100
And if the carry light was on,

210
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,630
the answer was a 2.

211
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,690
The circuit diagram works like this.

212
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,419
If neither switch A or B is closed,

213
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,249
so adding 0 + 0,

214
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,440
then no current flows through the circuit

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
and no light bulb would light up.

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,550
But if input A was closed,

217
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,200
the current would flow
through the solenoid,

218
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,820
creating a magnetic field

219
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,460
that pulls the switch inside it closed,

220
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,845
and this connects the
output light bulb to power

221
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,020
and disconnects the carry light bulb.

222
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,510
So the output light bulb lights up,

223
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,430
meaning that the answer is 1.

224
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,540
And the same thing would happen

225
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,050
when input B was closed and A was open.

226
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,609
But if you closed both
A and B simultaneously,

227
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:13,110
then there is no current
flowing through the solenoid

228
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,970
but there would be a current flowing

229
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,248
from the battery connected to A,

230
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,720
which is connected to
the carry light bulb.

231
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,070
So it lights up indicating 1 + 1 equals 2.

232
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,239
This is the beginning of the digital age,

233
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,630
and no it was not glamorous.

234
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,539
Stibitz built his device
out of a few batteries,

235
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,630
light bulbs, and relays
he had lying around.

236
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,050
And for the inputs, he
cut up a tin of tobacco.

237
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,450
He built it in one night
at his kitchen table

238
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,720
which is why it became
known as the Model K.

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,160
The circuit that Stibitz built

240
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,560
is now called a half adder.

241
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,910
But if you look at the circuit

242
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,650
through the eyes of Claude Shannon,

243
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,280
you realize it's actually
a pair of logic gates.

244
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,290
The output light bulb should turn on

245
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,460
when either A or B, but
not both, are closed,

246
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,850
so this is known as an exclusive OR gate.

247
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,890
Whereas the carry light
bulb should only turn on

248
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,034
when both A and B are closed,

249
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:10,140
so this is an AND gate.

250
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,300
This circuit uses electrical versions

251
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,570
of Boolean operators, XOR and AND.

252
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,790
And it's possible to build
other Boolean operators

253
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,742
as electronic gates

254
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:22,470
for things like OR, NOR, and NAND.

255
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,930
And you might say, what's the big deal?

256
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,640
I mean, the big deal is
that you just tricked

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,160
a bunch of electrons
into doing math for you.

258
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,927
Sure, it's very simple math,

259
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,570
but you could connect a bunch
of these half adders together

260
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,526
and build more and more
complicated circuits

261
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:38,340
that could do more complex math,

262
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,080
which is exactly what Stibitz

263
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,270
and his colleagues at Bell Labs did.

264
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,550
Two years later, they built the model I,

265
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,680
which had more than 400 relays

266
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,960
and could add two eight
digit numbers together

267
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,490
in a 10th of a second.

268
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,590
It could also multiply eight digit numbers

269
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,870
and do multiplication of complex numbers,

270
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,420
though these more complicated
operations took longer,

271
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,550
about a minute per calculation.

272
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,909
- So you put a voltage through a coil

273
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:04,470
and it'll turn that switch on or off.

274
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,963
So you've got your two operands here.

275
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,960
And if you wanna add two numbers together,

276
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,130
so 2 is this,

277
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,783
3 is this, right?

278
00:11:12,783 --> 00:11:16,290
So 1, 0 is 2.

279
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,123
- [Derek] Yeah.

280
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,470
- [David] And 1, 1 is 3.

281
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,270
And so then when you want to calculate it,

282
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,120
you just hit the go button down here.

283
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,100
We get 101.

284
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,140
- [Derek] I love the sound of that.

285
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,010
That is amazing.

286
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,293
- It's magical, so if
you wanna do like say,

287
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:35,370
8 plus, that would be 4

288
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,439
so 8 + 8, I think, right?

289
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,272
- [Derek] Okay.

290
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:39,105
- [David] Yeah, 8 + 8,

291
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,190
that would be, 16, no,
it clears it on its own.

292
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,450
- [Derek] Okay.

293
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,430
- [David] There you go.

294
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,419
Eight plus eight is 16 in binary,

295
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:49,713
which would be 1 0 0 0 0.

296
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,350
(machine clacking)

297
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,990
This is essentially a
1-bit arithmetic unit.

298
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,250
There's no logic functions.

299
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,780
It only ever does add.

300
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,026
Now, let's say we wanna do 5 - 2,

301
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,560
the answer's gonna be 3.

302
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,850
So we flip this little switch here

303
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,340
that lets me know that I'm
doing a subtraction operation

304
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,190
and we do subtraction
by doing 2's complement.

305
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,180
So essentially what we're doing

306
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,580
is we're inverting one of the operands

307
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,200
and we're adding one.

308
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,181
So now when I run it,

309
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,720
(machine clacking)

310
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,209
we can see 5 - 2 is equal to 3,

311
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,105
so 2 and 1 is 3.

312
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,210
Now, because of the way that we do this,

313
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,468
the final carry flag

314
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:25,560
ends up getting illuminated
here on the end.

315
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,650
But if we know that we're
doing a subtraction operation,

316
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,030
we know that this final carry flag

317
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,940
is never going to be on otherwise.

318
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,050
- [Derek] Over the next 10 years,

319
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,630
they built six more
computers based on relays

320
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,520
which were used by the US military

321
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,080
and the National Advisory Committee

322
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,660
for Astronautics or NACA,

323
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,970
which later would become NASA.

324
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,514
But even by the early 1940s,

325
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:49,500
it was clear that the
mechanical nature of the relay,

326
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,260
the physical closing and
opening of the switches,

327
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,140
was too slow to be the future of computers

328
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,030
and they were also prone to breaking.

329
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,650
- Anytime you have
something that's mechanical,

330
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,030
it's gonna wear down.

331
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,040
Every time that relay switches,

332
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,270
there's a little bit of friction

333
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,550
on the rotation point inside of there

334
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,260
and there's contacts

335
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,390
that are making and breaking
electrical connections,

336
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,590
and those are gonna wear out.

337
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,690
- [Derek] And all the
relays opening and closing

338
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,678
meant that the computers
were incredibly loud.

339
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,960
(machine clacking)

340
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,820
- So it doesn't really work

341
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,500
in a business environment all that well.

342
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,552
You can't really stuff it into your office

343
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,452
that you're gonna drive people insane.

344
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,180
- [Derek] So what computer
scientists really needed

345
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,070
was an electronic switch

346
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,253
and that is where the
vacuum tube triode comes in.

347
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,983
Whoa!

348
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,931
I mean, sure it can work as an amplifier

349
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,448
if you put slightly positive

350
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,850
or negative voltages on the grid,

351
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,520
but it can also work as a switch.

352
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,920
If the grid voltage is very negative,

353
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,480
then no current flows.

354
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,880
And if the grid voltage is very positive,

355
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,040
then maximum current flows.

356
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,140
So a triode can be controlled

357
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,360
using no moving parts.

358
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,160
Just a voltage will set it

359
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,680
to be either a 0 or a 1.

360
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,540
And best of all, switching between the two

361
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,450
can be done rapidly with no noise

362
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,938
since you're just controlling electrons

363
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:13,500
zipping around in a vacuum.

364
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,683
This is the invention that took
computing to the next level.

365
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,430
The world's first electronic
programmable computer

366
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,690
was called ENIAC

367
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,310
and it came online for the first time

368
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,830
on December 10th, 1945.

369
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,340
It took up a whole room, weighed 30 tons,

370
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,000
and used 175 kilowatts of power.

371
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,579
So much that it led to a rumor

372
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:35,997
that every time it turned on,

373
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,306
the lights in Philadelphia,

374
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:40,503
where ENIAC was located, would dim.

375
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,230
Now, that was just a rumor,

376
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,820
but mainly because ENIAC

377
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,604
had its own dedicated electrical generator

378
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:50,220
to keep up with the enormous power draw.

379
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,720
Unlike previous computers,

380
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,680
ENIAC wasn't limited

381
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,740
to just solving one type
of mathematical problem.

382
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,440
It could be programmed and it was fast,

383
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,860
completing 500 operations per second.

384
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,480
At the time, the word computers

385
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,545
still referred to people

386
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:07,470
doing calculations with pen and paper.

387
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,970
So 500 operations per
second was really fast.

388
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,890
ENIAC's flexibility and power

389
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,180
was immediately useful

390
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,430
for the development of the hydrogen bomb.

391
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,710
The computations needed were so complex

392
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,510
that the director of
Los Alamos at the time

393
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,280
said that, "It would've been impossible

394
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,930
to arrive at any solution

395
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,390
without the aid of ENIAC."

396
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,154
- This is a hilarious part
bout having a processor

397
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:33,180
that is 1 meter tall
and 70 centimeters wide,

398
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,330
is that you can point at
actual parts of the processor.

399
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,740
- [Derek] This is what a 1-bit

400
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,843
vacuum tube computer looks like.

401
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,060
- [David] Can you feel
the heat coming off of it?

402
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,140
- [Derek] I certainly can.

403
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,970
- [David] I can feel the heat coming off.

404
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,080
- [Derek] It's getting warm.

405
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,870
- Well, I mean, 190 vacuum tubes is a lot.

406
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,040
I think we figured it out.

407
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,520
This is pulling like 350
or 400 watts of power

408
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,854
or something like that,

409
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,910
which is absurd.

410
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,100
At night, it's awesome.

411
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,143
It looks like a city.

412
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,590
- [Derek] But there were also major flaws

413
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,850
with vacuum tubes.

414
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,830
The filaments always needed to be heated,

415
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,070
so they used a lot of
power even when idle,

416
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,450
and they were big.

417
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,000
It was hard to make a glass vacuum tube

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,900
with complex electrodes
inside arbitrarily small.

419
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,790
They were also unreliable.

420
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,212
On average, a vacuum tube in ENIAC

421
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:27,510
broke down every few days.

422
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,900
And then, it needed to
be found and replaced.

423
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,255
The longest that ENIAC
operated for without failure

424
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:36,690
was just 116 hours.

425
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,640
The first digital computers
ran on glorified light bulbs.

426
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,600
That is why they were so big,
power-hungry, and unreliable.

427
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,810
The miracle and what has made
our modern lives possible

428
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,130
is that someone figured out

429
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,070
how to perform the same
trick with electrons

430
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,990
inside a solid piece of
material, in silicon.

431
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,363
But that's a story for another day.

432
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,879
If you wanna learn about
how modern computing devices

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,380
store and access information,

434
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,880
I highly recommend you check out

435
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,339

to neural networks to quantum computing.

439
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,270
Their latest interactive course

440
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,520
is called How Technology Works.

441
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,589
It includes a lesson on computer memory

442
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,389
where you can get hands-on with the kinds

443
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,840
of computational logic gates
we discussed in this video.

444
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,230
It also has a lesson that
delves into the ingenious ways

445
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,630
video compression makes
modern day streaming possible,

446
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,210
so you can watch videos like this one.

447
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,460
Ever wondered how your
phone knows where you are?

448
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,410
There's a lesson on that too.

449
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,570
There's even a lesson on password theft

450
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,670
where you can walk in
the footsteps of a hacker

451
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,820
to discover why some passwords
are stronger than others.

452
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,380
You can try all these out for free

453
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,590
by going to brilliant.org/veritasium.

454
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,300
You know, whether it's
getting a working knowledge

455
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,180
of modern day technology
or building skills in math,

456
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,100
computer science or data science,

457
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,230
Brilliant is the best way to learn.

458
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,930
They have thousands of
bite-sized interactive lessons

459
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,466
that not only help master key concepts

460
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:11,730
but connect what you learn
to real-world examples.

461
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,830
And because each lesson is hands-on,

462
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,510
you'll build real intuition

463
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,880
so you can put what you've learned to use.

464
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,650
Now, as we've seen, the
development of technology

465
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,802
is an ongoing process
that constantly reshapes

466
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:24,480
the way we interact with
the world around us.

467
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,220
Today, it's more important than ever

468
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,200
to keep up with these changes.

469
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,051
Who knows what revolutionary
technology will emerge next?

470
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,330
But whatever it is, you can rest assured

471
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,610
that you'll be able to
learn about it on Brilliant.
