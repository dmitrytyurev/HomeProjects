1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,029
This will revolutionize education.

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,760
No prediction has been made as often or as
incorrectly as that one.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,389
In 1922, it was Thomas Edison who declared
that, “The motion picture is destined to

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,019
revolutionize our educational system and that
in a few years, it will supplant largely,

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,730
if not entirely, the use of textbooks.”

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,730
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,029
And you know how that worked out?

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:27,240
By the 1930s it was radio.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,270
The idea was you could beam experts directly
into classrooms, improving the quality of

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,930
education for more students at lower cost.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,860
And that would mean you require fewer skilled
teachers, a theme common to all of the proposed

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,760
education revolutions, like that of educational
television in the 1950s and 60s.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,050
Studies were conducted to determine whether
students preferred watching a lecture live,

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,950
or sitting in an adjacent room where the same
lecture was broadcast via closed circuit TV.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,950
What would you prefer?

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,220
In the 80s there was no debating.

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,950
Computers were the revolutionary solution to our education woes.

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,090
They were audiovisual, interactive, and could
be programmed to do almost anything you like.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,520
Well at the time, they could run Oregon Trail.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,060
But their potential was obvious.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,170
Researches suspected that if they could teach
kids to program, say how to move a turtle

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,310
around a screen, then their procedural reasoning
skills would also improve.

23
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,720
So how did it go?

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,469
Well the students got better at programming
the turtle, but their reasoning skills were

25
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:29,759
unaffected.

26
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,200
Even by the 1990s we had not learned from
the failure of our past predictions and I

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,060
quote, “The use of videodiscs in classroom
instruction is increasing every year and promises

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,009
to revolutionize what will happen in the classroom
of tomorrow.”

29
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,009
Videodiscs?

30
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,240
Yeah, those giant oversized CD things.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,420
Remember when they revolutionized education?

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,179
Nowadays plenty of things are poised to revolutionize
education like, smartboards, smartphones,

33
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,969
tables, and M.O.O.C.s.

34
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:01,689
Those are massive open online courses.

35
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,990
And some belief we’re getting close to universal
teaching machine, a computer so quick and

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,840
well-programmed that it’s basically like
having your own personal tutor in a machine.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,120 A student could work through well-structured lessons at their own pace receiving immediate and personally-tailored feedback, and all without the interference of a meddlesome and expensive teacher.

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,319


40
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,269
Do these claims sound familiar?

41
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:28,640
Over the past 100 years, a lot of areas of
life have been revolutionized, but education

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,430
is not one of them.

43
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,849
By in large, students are still taught in
groups by a single teacher.

44
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,500
And that is not what a revolution looks like.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,280
Some might blame this state of affairs on
the inertia of our educational institutions.

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,160
It’s just too hard to get a huge bureaucracy
to change.

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,740
But I think the reason technology hasn’t
revolutionized education is something else,

48
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,800
something that goes to the very heart of what
education is.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,739
Let’s consider the process of learning.

50
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,599
Say you want to teach someone how a human
heart pumps blood.

51
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,700
Which learning aid do you think would be more
effective, this animation with narration or

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,769
this set of static picture with text?

53
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,659
Obviously the animation is better.

54
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,370
I mean for one thing it shows exactly what
the heart does.

55
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,519
For decades, educational research focused
on questions like this.

56
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,530
Does a video promote learning better than
a book?

57
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,099
Are live lectures more effective than televised
lectures?

58
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,129
Is animation better than static graphics?

59
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,689
In all well-controlled studies, the result
is no significant difference.

60
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:35,110
That is, so long as the content is equivalent
between the two treatments, the learning outcomes

61
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,719
are the same with all different media.

62
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,250
How is this possible?

63
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,310
How can something which seems so powerful,
like animation, be no more effective than

64
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,640
static graphics?

65
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,540
Well for one thing, animations are fleeting
and so you might miss something as they go

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
by.

67
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,060
Plus, since the parts are animated for you,
you don’t have to mentally envision how

68
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,579
the parts are moving.

69
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,580
And so you don’t have to invest as much
mental effort which would make it more memorable.

70
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,409
In fact, sometimes static graphics perform
better than animations.

71
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:10,260
And I think this points to a really fundamental
aspect of education which is, it doesn’t

72
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,069
matter what happens around the learner.

73
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,670
We are not limited by the experiences we can
give to students.

74
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,430
What limits learning is what can happen inside
the student’s head.

75
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,060
That is where the important part of learning
takes place.

76
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,889
No technology is inherently superior to any other.

77
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,810
Researchers spent so much time investigating
whether one medium or technology was more

78
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,060
effective than another that they failed to
investigate exactly how to use the technology

79
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,500
to promote meaningful thought processes.

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,680
So the question really is what experiences
promote the kind of thinking that is required

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
for learning?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,610
Recently, that research is being conducted
and we’re finding out some pretty important

83
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,610
stuff.

84
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,620
I mean it may seem obvious, but it turns out
learning with words and pictures together,

85
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,110
whether they’re animation and narration
or static pictures and text, works better

86
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,669
than words alone.

87
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:10,090
Also, we see that anything which is extraneous
needs to be eliminated from a lesson.

88
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,660
For example, on-screen text competes with visuals, so learners perform better when it is omitted than when it is present.

89
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,030


90
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,169
Now that we know how best to make educational
videos, and any experience can be simulated

91
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,419
in the video setting, YouTube must be the
platform that will revolutionize education.

92
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,620
I mean the number of educational videos on
YouTube is increasing every day.

93
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,280
So why do we need teachers?

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,310
Well, if you think that the fundamental job
of a teacher is to transmit information from

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,150
their head to their students’, then you’re
right, they are obsolete.

96
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,460
I mean, you probably imagine a classroom where this teacher is spewing out facts at a pace which is appropriate for one student, too fast for half, and too slow for the rest.

98
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,180
Luckily the fundamental role of a teachers
is not to deliver information.

99
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,490
It is to guide the social process of learning.

100
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:08,100
The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge,
to excite their students to want to learn.

101
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,150
Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate
and show things, but fundamentally that is

102
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,220
beside the point.

103
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,150
The most important thing a teacher does is
make every student feel like they are important,

104
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,050
to make them feel accountable for doing the
work of learning.

105
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,080
All of this is not to say technology has had
no impact on education.

106
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,229
Students and teachers work and communicate
via computers.

107
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,610
And videos are used both inside and outside
of classrooms.

108
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,940
But all of this is best characterized as an
evolution, not a revolution.

109
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,650
The foundation of education is still based
on the social interaction between teachers

110
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,830
and students.

111
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,030
For as transformative as each new technology
seems to be, like motion pictures or computer

112
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,630
or smartboards, what really matters is what
happens inside the learner’s head.

113
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,860
And making a learner think seems best achieved
in a social environment with other learners

114
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,530
and a caring teacher.
