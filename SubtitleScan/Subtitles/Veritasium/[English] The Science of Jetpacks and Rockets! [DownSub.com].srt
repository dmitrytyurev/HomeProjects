1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,039
This is a water jet pack... but no, that's
not me flying it.

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
This is me.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
It's harder than it looks, ok?

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,150
But to understand how it works, we need to
first talk rocket science.

5
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,310
Rocket science is meant to be one of the most
complicated things in the world, but the basic

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,570
principle is incredibly simple.

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,089
It's just Newton's 3rd law -- all forces come
in pairs, which are equal and opposite.

8
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:44,000
To demonstrate this, I'm using a fire extinguisher
on a skateboard.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,870
As the carbon dioxide is forced out the back
of the extinguisher, it puts a force forwards

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:01:02,690
on me causing me to accelerate.

11
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,700
Or that's the theory anyway.

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,100
If you look closely, you can spot the exact
moment I realize this is a fail.

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,790
So what was the problem here?

14
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,160
Well the force applied to me by the carbon
dioxide is equal to the rate of mass ejected

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,960
out the back of the fire extinguisher, call
it m-dot for short, multiplied by the velocity

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,970
of that exhaust gas.

17
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,580
So in this case the carbon dioxide wasn't
ejected fast enough to create a big enough

18
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:41,390
force and overcome the small frictional forces
to get me to accelerate.

19
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,670
But it can be done as has been demonstrated
many times on Youtube.

20
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:53,200
When the space shuttle lifts off, exhaust
gasses exit the nozzle at 3 to 4 km/s, ejecting

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,549
an amount of mass of 9000 kg/s.

22
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:03,290
This creates thrust equal to 30,000,000 N
or the equivalent of about 2 million decent

23
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,049
fire extinguishers.

24
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:09,660
Now imagine you are an astronaut preparing
for launch in the space shuttle.

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,930
You'd be seated not vertically but horizontally,
perpendicular to the acceleration.

26
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,160
That's because the human body is a bit like
a water balloon where the water represents

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,010
your blood and the balloon represents your
harder parts like your skeleton.

28
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,570
Now, if you are accelerated up really quickly,
then your skeleton accelerates up at that

29
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,350
rate but your blood tends to stay where it
is.

30
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,859
And this results in the blood ending up in
your feet.

31
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:40,549
Now since there's not enough oxygen going
to your brain you would black out.

32
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:46,480
But fighter pilots face an arguably worse
fate when they accelerate down too fast, because

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,720
then the blood all rushes to their head and
they suffer something called a red-out, where

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,280
the blood actually comes out of their eyes,
nose, mouth, and ears.

35
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,670
But back to astronauts, since you are reclined,
at worst the blood will end up in the back

36
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,700
of your body and the back of your head, but
your brain will still have enough oxygen to

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,130
remain conscious.

38
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,150
Now as the spacecraft lifts off and starts
speeding up, the acceleration is initially

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,030
a very reasonable five to eight meters per
second squared - that's less acceleration

40
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,120
than an object in free fall here at the surface
of Earth.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,320
But as the spacecraft continues to burn fuel,
its mass decreases, while the thrust remains

42
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,820
essentially constant.

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,600
Now Newton's second law says that the acceleration
of an object equals the net force applied

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,949
to it divided by its mass.

45
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:43,160
So as the mass decreases, the acceleration
increases -- and it increases at an increasing

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
rate.

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,640
So much so that at the end of the rocket burn
the thrust has to actually be limited in order

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,590
to keep the acceleration from going over three
g's -- that's three times the acceleration

49
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,730
due to gravity or about 30 meters per second
squared.

50
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,070
Now the term g-force has been invented to
give a sense of the amount of force experienced

51
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,090
by astronauts, in multiples of the force we
experience everyday.

52
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,230
Right now you are experiencing one g-force,
probably on your butt if you're sitting down

53
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,029
-- can you feel that force?

54
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,179
But accelerating at three g's you would experience
three g-forces.

55
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,910
So the force between your back and the chair
would be the same as if you had two of you

56
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,450
stacked on top of you.

57
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,900
Hey, pipe down below, huh?

58
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,960
You guys are heavy.

59
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, man.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,120
You know that feeling when you're taking off
in a plane and it feels like you're pressed

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,640
into the seat, well really it's the seat pressing
into you.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,900
But if you imagine that feeling times 20,
that's what it would be like to be taking

63
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,660
off in the space shuttle.

64
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,700
Now an interesting side note is that we think
of the space shuttle's acceleration as being

65
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,620
mainly vertical because that's what we see
when it lifts off.

66
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,460
But that's actually not true.

67
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,210
Once the space shuttle exits the thicker part
of the atmosphere, it turns horizontal and

68
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,250
accelerates up to its orbital velocity 28,000
km/h.

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,600
So most of the acceleration of a spacecraft,
in orbit anyway, is horizontal.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,130
So how is this like a jet pack?

71
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,760
Well unlike the shuttle, you don't carry your
own propellant with you.

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,700
And also, there's no chemical reaction releasing
energy that drives the propellant downwards.

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:32,100
Instead the jetski pumps water out of the
lake and up that hose at a rate up to 60 litres

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,150
per second.

75
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,560
And then right on these nozzles here, the
water changes directions.

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,710
So it goes from coming up to being fired out
the bottom, and that change in momentum as

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,770
it goes over the bend is what actually pushed
the jetpack up.

78
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,280
Because the jetpack's pushing down on the
water, so by Newton's third law, the water

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,480
has to push up on the jetpack
generating 1800 Newtons of thrust, that's

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,700
roughly equivalent to 150 decent fire extinguishers.

81
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,620
This could accelerate me at up to 1.5 g's

82
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,170
And you use your hands in order to steer.

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,211
Lifting up to drive yourself upwards, moving
your hands down to accelerate forwards, and

84
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:14,000
pretend like you're turning a big wheel very
gently in order to turn side to side.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,670
One thing you don't want to do is try to explain
the physics of the jetpack while in the air.

86
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:29,280
That's what I was trying to do here...

87
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,210
While you're learning your thrust is controlled
by your instructor so if he sees you doing

88
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,430
something stupid he'll just turn off the thrust
and drop you into the lake so you don't hurt

89
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,680
yourself.

90
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,010
That's generally a good idea unless you're
on a collision course with the jetski.

91
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,790
I got a pretty fat lip from doing this but
thankfully all my teeth were intact.

92
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,750
When the thrust is equal to my weight plus
the weight of the water in the hose, then

93
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,330
I can hover or move with constant velocity.

94
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,480
It's a common misconception that you need
a little bit of unbalanced force to move with

95
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,560
a constant velocity -- in truth if the forces
are balanced, you will continue moving with

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,990
whatever constant velocity you have.

97
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,860
The other common misconception about rockets
is that you need something to push off like

98
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,360
the atmosphere.

99
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,240
In reality, what you are pushing off is the
propellant, so even without the air around

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,760
a water jetpack would still work because you're
pushing off the water that is coming out those

101
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
nozzles.

102
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,690
If you want to go jetpacking I recommend you
go easy on the controls.

103
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:34,020
I mean the worst thing you can do is overcompensate,
which I think is a typical human reaction,

104
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,920
because you're reacting to where you are and
how fast you're moving and you're not reacting

105
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,210
to acceleration which is the real thing that
you can control.

106
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,010
So even if you're coming down towards the
water quite quickly you may be slowing down

107
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,600
so it may be ok and you don't need to adjust
anything.

108
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,230
You just need to trust that the jetpack will
get you out of any trouble.

109
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:58,860
It's a pretty incredibly experience, feeling
the power of that water rushing passed you.

110
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,160
It's the closest I've gotten to flying really.

111
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,710
That's the power of physics.

112
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,770
Now many of you may not know that I have a
second channel

113
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,110
called 2 Veritasium and I've been posting
