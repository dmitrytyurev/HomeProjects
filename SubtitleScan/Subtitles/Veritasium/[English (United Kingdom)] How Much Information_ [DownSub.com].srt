1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,230
Have you ever noticed that people speaking
Spanish sound like they're talking really

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:11,690
fast?
Does this mean they are able to communicate

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,570
information faster than English speakers?
One reason why Spanish sounds so fast is because

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,279
more syllables are spoken per minute than
in English. However analysis has shown that

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,999
each Spanish syllable contains less information
than each English syllable so the information

6
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:32,020
per minute is almost identical.
But what about written language? The square

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,510
format of Chinese characters appears to fit
better into our central visual field than

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,600
the longer, slimmer words of English. This
led linguists to suspect that Chinese would

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,500
be read faster than English. But experiments
show that English readers can perceive seven

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,350
to eight letters at once, compared to just
2.6 characters for Chinese. However those

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,410
Chinese characters are denser in meaning than
the English letters and so both languages

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,670
have basically an identical reading rate of
380 words equivalent per minute.

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,970
This suggests that what limits the speed of
our communication is not language but our

14
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,910
cognitive ability to process information.
But how can you really quantify information?

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,130
Well the smallest amount of information you
can have is the answer to a yes/no question,

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,920
like have you seen the movie Frozen?
Yes or no, heads or tails, we can represent

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:32,240
this single outcomes with a one or a zero.
One binary digit - it's one bit of information.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,070
A roll of the dice has six possible outcomes
so three bits of information are required

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,490
to cover all the options.
To uniquely represent all 26 letters of the

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,000
English alphabet requires five bits of information.
But if you include lower case, punctuations,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,110
specially characters and number, that takes
the total number of symbols to 95. So you

22
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,140
actually need seven bits of information to
encode all these symbols.

23
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,530
That was first done in 1963 as the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange,

24
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,580
or ASCII for short.
Now as the next closes power of two, computers

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,840
adopted eight bits as the fundamental unit
of computation, and they called it the bite,

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,590
where they intentionally replaced the i with
a y so that it couldn't accidentally be confused

27
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,520
with a bit.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,400
So how much information does it take to make
you? Well your entire genetic code is contained

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,819
in the sequence of four molecules, represented
by the letters T, A, G, and C in your DNA.

30
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,099
Each of these four options can be encoded
by two bits of information. And multiplying

31
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,069
by the six billion letters of genetic code
in your genome, and dividing by eight bits

32
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,170
per byte, that yields 1.5 GB of information.
So you could fit your entire genetic code

33
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:48,551
on a single DVD with room to spare. Now your
body has an estimated 40 trillion cells in

34
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:55,170
it and each one contains a full copy of your
DNA. So you actually contain sixty zettabytes

35
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,440
of information. That's sixty followed by 21
zeroes.

36
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,140
Just to put this in perspective, by the year
2020, all of the digital information in the

37
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,819
world is estimated to be equal to forty zettabytes
of information. You could store all of that

38
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:15,280
on 100 grams of DNA. That is less than you
have inside your body.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,840
But now consider this, you share 99.9% of
your genetic information with everyone else

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,659
on Earth, meaning that less than one part
in a thousand is unique. So the information

41
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:33,319
that makes you you could be stored in less
than a megabyte. You could put it on one of

42
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,989
these, a floppy disk, in case you don't know
what that is.

43
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,499
In contrast video can contain a lot of information.
To specify the colour of each of two million

44
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:48,590
pixels thirty times a second for this entire
video would require 100 gigabytes of information.

45
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,069
But you can watch this video in HD on Youtube
with just a thousandth that amount. Now the

46
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,530
reason you can send such a big video with
such a small file size is because video, like

47
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,739
Spanish, has a lot of parts that are redundant.
Hey Michael, you know what I've been thinking

48
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,889
about.
What have you been thinking about Derek?

49
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,390
Information.
Go on.

50
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:15,439
It's a physical thing. It's embodied in actual
objects.

51
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,110
How's that?
Well you know like the words we say, they

52
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,600
are actual vibrations in the air, right? They're
not just concepts. They are real physical

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,310
things that you could measure and detect.
That's true and they don't go away, they don't

54
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,090
disappear even after they've, for instance,
moved through the air.

55
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,560
Right. After we've said these words, they
have actually interacted with everything around

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
us.
So you're saying that technically, I could

57
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,660
look at the world and if I knew enough about
it and the position of its particles, I could

58
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,290
trace back and extrapolate all the information
that's ever occurred through them or at them?

59
00:04:51,290 --> 00:05:02,590
That's right. You could in principle figure
out exactly what we've said here, today.

60
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,280
Woah.
This episode of Veritasium was inspired by

61
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,510
the book The Information by James Gleick.

65
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,300
already read The Information you may want
to check out Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman

66
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,400
by Richard Feynman. It's my favourite book
by a scientist. It is absolutely hilarious

67
