00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,450
Shh...

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,059
I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain
how a wing actually works

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,200
Hang on, something doesn't feel right.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,120
Ah, that's better.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,590
Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift
due to its characteristic shape

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,040
Since air travels farther over top of the
wing, it must go faster than the air underneath

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,000
so that both streams meet up simultaneously
at the trailing edge

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,230
And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster
flowing air exerts less pressure than the

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,890
slower air beneath the wing
This pressure difference creates an upward

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,620
force -- lift.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,710
Job done.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,710
Right?

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,620
Nope
This simple explanation taught in many textbooks

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,430
and classrooms has obvious problems
Like how could a plane fly upside down?

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,810
Some planes like the Wright brothers' had
nearly flat wings.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,130
So presumably air would travel the same speed
over both sides and there would be no lift

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,290
Plus experiments show that air streams don't
meet up at the back of the wing.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,250
Air over the top goes significantly faster,
reaching the trailing edge first.

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,559
So how does a wing actually generate lift?

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,710
Well the key is the wing must deflect air
downwards

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,210
This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered
air foils

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,819
Or by increasing the angle of attack
Air under the wing is deflected down

23
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:19,399
And by the coanda effect
air above the wing is guided along its surface

24
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,090
and down as well
Since the air is slowed and deflected down

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,459
by the wing,
it pushes the wing up and back.

26
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,469
Lift, and drag.

27
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,939
This is in accordance with Newton's Third
Law of Motion

28
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:36,310
But hang on, if you can explain lift only
using the deflection of air and Newton's laws,

29
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,509
then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely
wrong

30
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,859
Well, no,
air over the top of the wing does go faster

31
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,590
than air beneath, creating a pressure difference
that generates lift

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,229
Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary
rubbish and the original explanation was right!

33
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,329
That's not true either.

34
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,380
The original explanation incorrectly assumed
that air over and under the wing must reconnect

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,040
at the trailing edge, and there was no mention
of deflecting air down.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,999
Each explanation, done correctly, completely
accounts for the lift generated by a wing.

37
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,840
They're just two different ways of looking
at the same thing.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,349
So next time someone brings up the standard
misconception, you can tell them that explanation

39
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,760
just doesn't fly.

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,250
And if you liked that, you've gotta check
out MinutePhysics.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,739
I've got total respect for a guy who does
this every week.

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:38,049
Sincerely, a collection of particles known
as Derek.
