1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,099
This is aerogel.
The world's lightest, that is least dense, solid.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,700
This piece has a mass of just 1.22 grams.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:18,440
That is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air, which kind of makes sense because it is

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,160
99.8% air. In fact, some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them,

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,840
they would be less dense than air. I have long been fascinated by aerogel

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,559
so I actually flew out to Aerogel Technologies in Boston to find out why was aerogel invented. How is it made?

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,610
Why is it such a good thermal insulator and what is it used for?

8
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,980
- Okay, we are going to try an experiment to demonstrate the insulating power of aerogel so over here we have

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,849
two setups: one with a glass petri dish, and the other one with aerogel on top.

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,989
- Both are made of silica, but with very different physical structures.

11
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,279
We're gonna see how long it takes to melt these chocolate bunnies with a Bunsen burner.

12
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,220
- Now to have a look at this experiment,

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,220
we have a FLIR T1020 which can see temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,940
- Looks like it's getting pretty hot.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,120
- Yeah, you can see that the glass is getting really hot already. And after just a minute:

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,680
- It's starting to smoke.
- Okay.

17
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,340
- It's definitely melting and smoking.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,120
Oh, yeah, here we go. I would say that's phase change.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,660
- We've got

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,860
a liquid chocolate situation. We have some smoking bunny. Over here,

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,560
the bunny is actually sort of melting over, and look, there, it's sort of tilting to the side.

22
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,120
- Alright, I think we're going to call that a melt.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,520
- What is that?
- Oh!

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
On cue, on cue.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,960
[Laughs.]

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,500
- I would say that is material fail.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,120
- Not only did the bunny melt quickly, the petri dish cracked under the thermal expansion.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,740
- Wanna pop it in?

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,640
- So now let's try the aerogel.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,340
[Music]
- So how is aerogel invented back in?

31
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,340
- Back in 1931, a guy named Professor Samuel Kistler had a bet with his colleague Charles Learned.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,700
- Now the bet revolved around jellies,
like peanut-butter-and-jelly jellies.

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,780
Now the thing about jellies is they are actually a combination of liquids and solids.

34
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,360
[Music]

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,000
I mean, they're mostly liquid,
but it's embedded within this 3D solid structure.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,980
- So if you think of a gel, like jello, has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that gives it its rigidity,

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,580
and then that's about 1% of the gel.

38
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,940
- So the bet was this:

39
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,000
Could you remove the liquid from the jelly?

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,690
Without affecting the solid structure?
I mean, if you just evaporate the liquid out, well,

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,640
then the solid structure shrinks, because as you remove liquid molecules, they pull on each other, and they pull on the solid structure around them, basically crumpling it from the inside.

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,360
Now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways.

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,200
First, he realized you could replace one liquid with another

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,739
inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly. So you could swap out, say,

46
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:16,220
water, for alcohol. And then, if you take the jelly and put it in a high-pressure vessel called a autoclave,

47
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,680
- By heating it to the high-temperature, high-pressure point called the critical point of the liquid,

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,540
that liquid transformed into a semi-liquid, semi-gas called a supercritical fluid.

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,380
- At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas.

50
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,740
Those molecules are no longer pulling on each other.

51
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:40,820
- So once you've depressurized the vessel, that solid skeleton, that 1% of the mass of the gel, is left behind

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,240
intact, except for where there was liquid in the pores before is now gas,

53
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,900
and that solid skeleton, that nanoporous solid is what we call aerogel.

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,260
- Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,380
It is getting pretty hot as you can see through the thermal camera.

56
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,920
But coming up on three minutes, there's still no sign of melted chocolate.

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,440
So we're gonna pull out a thermocouple and just check the temperature underneath the bunny.

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,620
Like, underneath the aerogel, and see what, what the flame temperature is.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,529
You can kind of see that, that parts of the bunny are getting hot, but it's not the bottom of the bunny,

60
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,885
It's all the, around the bunny.

61
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:21,060
- Exactly. That convective heat is moving up and around the aerogel,

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,180
- So you can see the thing is getting red hot.
- And by four minutes, the bunny is looking a little soft.

63
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,458
- Still pretty good though, considering how easy it is to melt chocolate.

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,900
- Can I put my finger here?

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,660
- Be careful.

66
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,440
It's not that it's hot, it's that it's brittle.
- Right.

67
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,900
- But yeah, totally cool to touch, right?
- It is, it is just warm to the touch.

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,620
- He made aerogels out of all sorts of things.

69
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,080
He made them out of eggs.
He made them out of rubber, out of nitrocellulose.

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,160
And, included in there was silica. Actually right here on the table, I have some examples of some silica gels.

71
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,840
This is a, a wet silica gel

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,600
It's kind of rubbery so I can just,
you know, carve out a piece.

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,060
It is 97% alcohol inside of its pores.

74
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,380
And then the remaining 3% solid is amorphous silica. Just--

75
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,500
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of rubbery. Not that strong.

76
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,440
- So was I cracking it there or was it already kinda cracked?

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
- Yeah, you just, no--
- Oh whoa, it's very easy to break. Very crumbly.

78
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,280
- The next step is to replace the alcohol in the gel with liquid carbon dioxide.

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,400
- We're about to see liquid CO₂.

80
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,360
- Liquid CO₂ has the advantage of being non-flammable, plus it's got a low critical temperature.

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,220
- Open it up, and--
- Yeah, I see it flooding in there.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,100
- Yeah, it's flooding in. There it goes.
Just another solvent.

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,480
[Vibration.]

84
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,480
- You can clearly see that it's so much cooler on top.

85
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,120
- What temperature is it on the bottom?
- We're at 600 right now?

86
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,920
- 600 degrees Celsius.
- 600 degrees Celsius, that's 1250 Fahrenheit right now.

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,180
- Notice where the bunny is melting.

88
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:02,560
It's melting right on that edge where the heat's, like, the flame is kind of crawling up and over. - So, yeah, that's

89
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,440
- Oh!

90
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Bunny down! [Laughs.]

91
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,840
- Well, not a bad result.
- Not a bad result at all.

92
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,880
- I'm interested in in tasting some of this chocolate here.

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,080
( - Gross.)

94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,860
- Is it hot?

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,140
- It's warm. 
- Warm.

96
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,780
- And delicious.
- Like fondue.

97
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,800
- Mm-hmm. That was great.

98
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Once the liquid CO₂ has filled all the pores of the gel, it's time to take it supercritical.

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,380
- It was, I would say, a kind of a spiritual experience the first time that I saw a supercritical fluid.

100
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,480
- We'll get to that here.

101
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,740
- [Laughs.] I love how much you're into these autoclaves.
- I love aerogels.

102
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,640
To make a supercritical fluid,

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,100
we can heat this with a hairdryer actually.

104
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,460
[Hairdryer blows.]

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,460
As we approach the critical point, the surface of the liquid becomes kind of blurry.

106
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,360
- Weird, huh?

107
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,480
- That is like weird waves in there, yeah.

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,820
I'll speed it up so you can watch the surface disappear altogether.

109
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,140
You're now looking at the supercritical fluid of CO₂.

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,960
In this state, the CO₂ can be vented without affecting the solid structure, and what you're left with is aerogel.

111
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,840
♫

112
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,340
- If you look at aerogel on a light background,

113
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,160
it's almost impossible to see,
because it is pretty transparent.

114
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,600
But if you look at it on a darker background,

115
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,480
then you can see that it has a slight bluish color.

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
And, it's bluish for the same reason that the sky is blue,

117
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,280
because all those tiny little nanoscale structures,

118
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,280
they scatter the light according to Rayleigh scattering.

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,560
And, the intensity of light scattered is proportional to
1 over wavelength to the power of 4,

120
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,300
which means it scatters shorter wavelengths, like blue, much more than it scatters yellow or red.

121
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,640
And, for that reason, aerogel looks opaque in the ultraviolet and transparent in the infrared.

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,560
- Now, what do you think this would look like
if I held it up to the blue sky?

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,840
What do you think we would see?
Would it look ultra blue?

124
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,040
No, it looks yellow. And that's because the aerogel is actually scattering out that blue light,

125
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,400
and so what passes through and makes it to our eyes is the longer wavelengths like the yellows and oranges.

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,160
It's basically the same effect as looking at a sunset

127
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,020
When you see the yellows and oranges of a sunset,

128
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
it's because the blue light
has already been scattered out

129
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,880
by the atmosphere the light had to pass through
before it reached your eyes.

130
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,099
So effectively looking at aerogel against blue sky
is like looking at a portable sunset.

131
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,200
The nanoscale pores of the aerogel are also what makes it such a good thermal insulator.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,100
( - Three.)

133
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,120
- That's awesome.

134
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,120
- Does that look hot?
- It's definitely hot.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,260
- You might think that because aerogel is

136
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,080
largely comprised of air, like 99% air,

137
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,160
that it has the same thermal properties as air,
but that is not correct.

138
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,810
It's actually a better insulator than air is.

139
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,620
- That's because the width of the pores is smaller than the distance air molecules travel on average

140
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,020
before colliding with something.

141
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,340
Their so-called mean free path.

142
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,880
Hence, it's really difficult for the hot, fast-moving air molecules below the aerogel

143
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,640
to diffuse through it and transfer heat to the top of the aerogel.

144
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,740
This is called the Knudsen effect.
- It is so weird because

145
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,060
you know, you don't expect something that's transparent to block the heat that well, but this really does.

146
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,389
- And that's why NASA used aerogel insulation on the Sojourner Rover,

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,920
Spirit and Opportunity, the Curiosity Rover, and they plan to use it on future missions to Mars.

148
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,280
- Why does it need insulation?
- The electronics, because

149
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,380
they don't want the electronics to get cold during the cold nights on Mars

150
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,240
- NASA has also put aerogel to more exotic uses,

151
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,980
notably to catch dust from a comet
as part of the Stardust mission.

152
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,440
- So the particles were traveling about six kilometers per second relative to the aerogel

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,080
So when they hit the aerogel, because the aerogel's
a very low density material, very, very porous material,

154
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,460
the particles actually enter the aerogel,
and as they travel through the aerogel,

155
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,360
they basically break apart the network that makes up the aerogel and they lose energy in the process

156
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
and eventually come to a stop.

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,720
This is good for capturing particles,

158
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,440
because if a particle like that were to hit a solid surface then it just stops, you know, immediately.

159
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,520
- It just vaporizes.
- And vaporizes.

160
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,989
- So should we expect to see aerogel in our everyday lives anytime soon?

161
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:47,840
- One of my running jokes is when they build skyscrapers in Antarctica, they'll use aerogel as thermal insulation.

162
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,340
[Both laugh.]

163
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
- Why do you say that?

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,660
- Well, because then they'll really care about how,

165
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,680
just how thermal efficient it is
because it would be so cold there.

166
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,180
- Right.

167
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,900
- So instead of having, you know, ten feet of fiberglass insulation, you could have six inches or something of aerogel.

168
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,560
- Scientists are currently working on reducing costs and increasing durability.

169
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,310
- And that's true. They do have some elasticity.
- Okay.

170
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,910
- Yeah, so there we go. So it is not hard to break.

171
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,549
- They've already made a lot of progress.
For example, original silica aerogel is hydrophilic.

172
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,980
- There we go. Now this is a hydrophilic aerogel.

173
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,500
- So once we've done this, is that piece of aerogel ruined now?

174
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,220
- Pretty much.

175
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,920
- But there are ways to make it waterproof.

176
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,020
So if you want to see that and all the other next generation aerogels,

177
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,880
then subscribe to the channel and this may be the start of an aerogel trilogy.

178
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,440
