1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:01,590
- [Derek] This tiny robot mouse

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,623
can finish this maze in just six seconds.

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,389
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,230
Every year, around the world,

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,050
people compete in the
oldest robotics race.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,490
The goal is simple:

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,860
get to the end of the
maze as fast as possible.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,641
- The person who came second

9
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:23,760
(announcer chattering)
(people cheering)

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,830
lost by 20 milliseconds.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,293
- [Derek] But competition
has grown fierce.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,697
- When somebody saw my design,
they said, "You're crazy!"

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,980
- [Derek] Why is there so much
tension? What's riding on it?

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,514
Honor?
- Honor

15
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:40,987
(audience applauding)

16
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:43,987
(audience cheering)

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,130
- [Derek] This video is

18
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,360
In 1952, mathematician
Claude Shannon constructed

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,890
an electronic mouse named
Theseus that could solve a maze.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,500
The trick to making the mouse intelligent

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,070
was hidden in a computer
built into the maze itself,

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,590
made of telephone relay switches.

23
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,830
The mouse was just a magnet
on wheels, essentially,

24
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,660
following an electromagnet controlled

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,700
by the position of the relay switches.

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,590
- [Claude] He is now exploring the maze

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,890
using a rather involved
strategy of trial and error.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,937
As he finds the correct path,

29
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:21,150
he registers the
information in his memory.

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,260
Later, I can put him down

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,990
in any part of the maze
that he's already explored,

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,910
and he'll be able to
go directly to the goal

33
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,370
without making a single false turn.

34
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,960
- [Derek] Theseus is often referred to

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,810
as one of the first examples
of machine learning.

36
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,580
A director at Google recently said

37
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,853
that it inspired the whole field of AI.

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,270
25 years later, editors at the Institute

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,480
of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers, or IEEE,

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,210
caught wind of a contest
for electronic mice,

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,270
or le mouse electronique,
as they had heard.

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,350
They were ecstatic. Were these the successors to Theseus?

43
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,690
But something had been
lost in translation.

44
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,780
These mice were just batteries in cases,

45
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,870
not robots capable of
intelligent behavior.

46
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,847
But the misunderstanding stuck
with them, and they wondered,

47
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,650
"Why couldn't we hold that
competition ourselves?"

48
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,890
In 1977, the announcement for IEEE's

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,960
Amazing Micro-Mouse Maze Contest

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,810
attracted over 6,000 entrants,

51
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,350
but the number of successful
competitors dwindled rapidly.

52
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,350
Eventually, just 15 entrants
reached the finals in 1979.

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,403
But by this point,

54
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:30,690
the contest had garnered
enough public interest

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,260
to be broadcast nationwide
on the evening news.

56
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,080
And just like the rumor that
inspired the competition,

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,486
Micromouse began to
spread across the world.

58
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:43,799
♪ Micromouse, is for the taking ♪

59
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,373
♪ Micromouse, is here and now ♪

60
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:51,075
♪ Take a chance, and start creating ♪

61
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:55,818
(upbeat music)
(reporter speaking Japanese)

62
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:57,068
- A Micromouse?

63
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:03,191
- [Group] Micromouse!

64
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:08,672
(audience applauding)

65
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,140
- Even people in the top two or three,

66
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,940
you can see them trying
to set their mice up,

67
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,400
and they can barely find
the buttons to press,

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,443
because it's absolutely nerve-racking.

69
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:45,224
(suspenseful music)

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,780
It doesn't matter what it
was, it could be horse racing,

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,330
it could be motor racing,
it could be mouse racing,

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,490
If you have a shred of
competitiveness in you,

73
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,197
you'd wanna win, right?

74
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,393
- [Derek] Just like a real mouse,

75
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,840
a Micromouse has to be fully autonomous.

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,230
No internet connection,
no GPS or remote control

77
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,080
and no nudging it to help it get unstuck.

78
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,630
It has to fit all its computing, motors,

79
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,880
sensors, and power supply in a frame

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,660
no longer or wider than 25 centimeters.

81
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,060
There isn't a limit on
the height of the mouse,

82
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,040
but the rules don't allow climbing,

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,830
flight, or any forms of combustion,

84
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,936
so rocket propulsion, for
example, is out of the equation.

85
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:35,211
(audience cheering)

86
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:38,461
(announcer chattering)

87
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,460
The maze itself is a square
about three meters on each side,

88
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,890
subdivided by walls into corridors

89
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,200
only 18 centimeters across.

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
And in 2009,

91
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,100
the half-size Micromouse
category was introduced,

92
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,130
with mice smaller than 12
1/2 centimeters per side,

93
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,370
and paths just nine centimeters across.

94
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,950
The final layout of the
maze is only revealed

95
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,960
at the start of each competition,

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,910
after which competitors are not allowed

97
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,103
to change the code in their mice.

98
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,416
(announcer speaking in Japanese)

99
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,400
(audience cheering)

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,990
The big three competitions,

101
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,260
All Japan, Taiwan, and USA's APEC,

102
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,810
usually limit the time
mice get in the maze

103
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,640
to seven or 10 minutes,

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,800
and mice are only allowed five runs

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,090
from the start to the goal.

106
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,843
- So if you spend a lot of time
searching, that's a penalty.

107
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,540
- Makes sense.

108
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,700
So the strategy for most Micromice

109
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,820
is to spend their first run
carefully learning the maze

110
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,860
and looking for the best path to the goal,

111
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,050
while not wasting too much time.

112
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,940
Then they use their remaining tries

113
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,393
to sprint down that path for
the fastest run time possible.

114
00:05:57,254 --> 00:06:00,120
(audience applauding)

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,250
Solving a maze may sound simple enough,

116
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,750
though it's important to remember that,

117
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,390
with only a few infrared sensors for eyes,

118
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,970
the view from inside the
maze is a lot less clear

119
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,860
than what we see from above.

120
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,830
Still, you can solve a
maze with your eyes closed.

121
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,080
If you just put one hand along one wall,

122
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,800
you will eventually reach
the end of most common mazes.

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,780
And that's exactly what some initial

124
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,150
Micromouse competitors realized, too.

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,220
And after a simple wall-following mouse

126
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,380
took home gold in the first finals,

127
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,990
the goal of the maze was
moved away from the edges,

128
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,360
and free-standing walls were added,

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,710
which would leave a simple

130
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,173
wall-following mouse searching forever.

131
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,790
Your next instinct might
be to run through the maze,

132
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,190
taking note of every fork in the road.

133
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,230
Whenever you reach a dead end or a loop,

134
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,000
you can go back to the last intersection

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,770
and try a different path.

136
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,690
If your last left turn got you nowhere,

137
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,140
you'd come back to that
intersection and go right instead.

138
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,460
You can think of this strategy

139
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,890
as the one a headstrong mouse might use,

140
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,960
running as deep into the maze as it can,

141
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,170
and turning back only when
it can't go any further.

142
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,230
This search strategy, known
as depth-first search,

143
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,780
will eventually get the mouse to the goal.

144
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,930
The problem is, it might
not be the shortest route,

145
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,690
because the mouse only
turns back when it needs to,

146
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,633
so it may have missed a
shortcut that it never tried.

147
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,220
The sibling to this search
algorithm, breadth-first search,

148
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,140
would find the shortest path.

149
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,160
With this strategy,

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,440
the mouse runs down one
branch of an intersection,

151
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
until it reaches the next one,

152
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,460
and then it goes back to
check the path it skipped,

153
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,250
before moving on to the
next layer of intersections.

154
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,920
So the mouse checks
every option it reaches,

155
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
but all that backtracking

156
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,870
means that it's rerunning
paths dozens of times.

157
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,703
At this point,

158
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:47,130
even searching the whole
maze often takes less time.

159
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,930
So why not just do that?

160
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,980
A meticulous mouse could search
all 256 cells of the maze,

161
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,770
testing every turn and corner to ensure

162
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,320
it has definitely found the shortest path.

163
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,563
But searching so thoroughly
isn't necessary, either.

164
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,640
Instead, the most popular
Micromouse strategy

165
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,980
is different from all of these techniques.

166
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,280
It's a search algorithm
known as flood fill.

167
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,050
This mouse's plan is to make

168
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,060
optimistic journeys through the maze,

169
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,820
so optimistic, in fact,
that on their first journey,

170
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,940
their map of the maze doesn't
have any walls at all.

171
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,870
They simply draw the shortest
path to the goal and go.

172
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,700
When their optimistic plan inevitably

173
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,650
hits a wall that wasn't on their map,

174
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,060
they simply mark it down

175
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,299
and update their new
shortest path to the goal.

176
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,929
Running, updating, running, updating,

177
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,269
always beelining for the goal.

178
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,679
Under the hood of the algorithm,

179
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,749
what the Micromouse is
marking on their map

180
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,170
is the distance from every
square in the maze to the goal.

181
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,290
To travel optimistically,
the mouse follows the trail

182
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,660
of decreasing numbers down to zero.

183
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,860
Whenever they hit a wall,

184
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,600
they update the numbers on their map

185
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,110
to reflect the new shortest
distance to the goal.

186
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,730
This strategy of following

187
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,650
the numerical path of least resistance

188
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,530
gives the flood fill algorithm its name.

189
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,960
The process resembles
flooding the maze with water

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,663
and updating values based on the flow.

191
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,390
Once the mouse reaches the goal,

192
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,280
it can smooth out the path it took

193
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,290
and get a solution to the maze.

194
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,800
However, it may look back
and imagine an even shorter,

195
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,110
uncharted path it could've taken.

196
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,760
The mouse might not be satisfied

197
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,340
that it's found the
shortest path just yet.

198
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,990
While this algorithm isn't guaranteed

199
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,480
to find the best path on first pass,

200
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,730
it takes advantage of
the fact that Micromice

201
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,640
need to return to the start
to begin their next run.

202
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,880
So if the mouse treats its
return as a new journey,

203
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,140
it can use the return trip
to search the maze as well.

204
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,780
Between these two attempts,
both optimized to find

205
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,640
the shortest path from start to finish,

206
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,580
it's extremely likely that
the mouse will discover it,

207
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,710
and the mouse will have
done it efficiently,

208
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,210
often leaving irrelevant areas

209
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,670
of the maze entirely untouched.

210
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,090
Flood fill offers both an
intelligent and practical way

211
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,960
for Micromice to find the
shortest path through the maze.

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,690
Once there was a clear strategy
to find the shortest path,

213
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,790
and once the microcontrollers and sensors

214
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,010
required to implement it became common,

215
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,130
some people believed
Micromouse had run its course.

216
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,177
As a paper published in IEEE put it,

217
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,730
"At the end of the 1980s,

218
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,580
the Micromouse Contest
had outlived itself.

219
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,780
The problem was solved,

220
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,327
and did not provide any new challenges."

221
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,660
(people chattering)

222
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,810
In the 2017 All Japan
Micromouse Competition,

223
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,150
both the bronze-and silver-placing mice

224
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,880
found the shortest path to
the goal, and once they did,

225
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,573
they were able to zip along
it as quick as 7.4 seconds.

226
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:41,520
(audience applauding)

227
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,790
But Masakazu Utsunomiya's
winning mouse, Red Comet,

228
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,250
did something entirely different.

229
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,410
This is the shortest path to the goal,

230
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,120
the one that everyone took.

231
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,030
This is the path that Red Comet took.

232
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,180
It's a full 5 1/2 meters longer.

233
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,340
That's because Micromice
aren't actually searching

234
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,570
for the shortest path,

235
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,820
they're searching for the fastest path.

236
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,010
And Red Comet's search
algorithm figured out

237
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,860
that this path had fewer
turns to slow it down.

238
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,140
So even though the path was longer,

239
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,420
it could end up being faster.

240
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,581
So it took that risk.

241
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:18,664
(announcer speaking in Japanese)

242
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,670
(audience applauding)

243
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,680
- [Derek] It won by 131 milliseconds.

244
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,700
(upbeat music)

245
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,050
Differing routes at competition

246
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,850
are now more common than not,

247
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,730
and even just getting to
the goal remains difficult,

248
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,650
whether due to a mysterious algorithm

249
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,543
or a quirk of the physical maze.

250
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:40,470
(audience laughing)

251
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,380
- [Commentator] The corner,
it's a little bit like a...

252
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,352
Whoa!

253
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:48,210
(commentator speaking in Japanese)

254
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,010
- [Derek] Micromice don't
always behave as you'd expect.

255
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:56,230
(competitor speaking in Japanese)

256
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,240
(upbeat music)

257
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,130
Micromouse is far from solved,

258
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,110
because it's not just a software problem

259
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,570
or a hardware problem, it's both.

260
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,580
It's a robotics problem.

261
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,720
Red Comet didn't win

262
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,310
because it had a better search algorithm

263
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,290
or because it had faster motors.

264
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,180
Its cleverness came from how the brains

265
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,910
and body of the mouse interacted together.

266
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,372
- So it turns out solving
the maze is not the problem.

267
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,870
It never was the problem, right?

268
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,580
But it's actually about navigation,

269
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,290
and it's about going fast.

270
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,710
- Every year, the robots get
smaller, faster, lighter.

271
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,620
There is still plenty of innovation left.

272
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,370
And there's a small group of devotees in Japan busy building quarter-size Micromouse which would sit on a quarter.

273
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,710
busy building quarter-size Micromouse

274
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,273
which would sit on a quarter.

275
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:50,490
(commentator speaking in Japanese)

276
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,960
- [Derek] Nearly 50 years on,

277
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,673
Micromouse is bigger than ever.

278
00:12:56,746 --> 00:13:00,662
(commentator speaking in Japanese)

279
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:03,662
(audience cheering)

280
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,010
- [Derek] Competitions
have appeared solved

281
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,630
at first glance before.

282
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,510
The high jump was an Olympic sport since 1896, with competitors refining their jumps using variations like the scissor, the western roll, and the straddle over the decades, with diminishing returns.


283
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,280


284
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,220



285
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,610
and the straddle over the decades, with diminishing returns.

286
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,880
But once foam padding became standard in competition,

287
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,760
Dick Fosbury rewrote the sport in 1968

288
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,410
by becoming the first Olympian

289
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,960
to jump over the pole backwards.

290
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,150
Now almost every high jumper does

291
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,193
what's known as the Fosbury flop.

292
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,000
If Micromouse had indeed
stopped in the 1980s,

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,210
the competition would've
missed its own Fosbury flops,

294
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,140
two innovations that completely
changed how Micromice ran.

295
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,750
After all, a lot can change
in a sport where competitors

296
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,213
can solder on any
upgrade they can imagine.

297
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,120
The first Fosbury flop

298
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,700
was one of the earliest
innovations in Micromouse,

299
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,250
and had nothing to do with technology.

300
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,980
It was simply a way of
thinking outside the box,

301
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,440
or rather, cutting through the box.

302
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,173
Every mouse used to
turn corners like this.

303
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,110
(Micromouse whirring)

304
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,123
But everything changed
with the mouse Mitee 3.

305
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:16,353
- So Mitee Mouse 3 implemented
diagonals for the first time.

306
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:21,188
(people chattering)

307
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,170
And that turned out to
be a much better idea

308
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,430
than we really thought.

309
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,710
And because it's cool, you know,

310
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,650
maze designers often put
diagonals into the maze now.

311
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,910
So, you know,

312
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,130
you could end up with a maze
where it never comes up,

313
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,860
but most of the time
it's actually a benefit.

314
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,720
- [Derek] In order to pull off diagonals,

315
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,700
the chassis of the mouse had to be reduced

316
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,980
to less than 11 centimeters wide,

317
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,770
or just five centimeters
for half-size Micromouse.

318
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,680
The sensors and software of
the mouse had to change, too.

319
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,540
When you're running
between parallel walls,

320
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,760
all you have to do is
maintain an equal distance

321
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,400
between your left and
right infrared readings.

322
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,880
But a diagonal requires
an entirely new algorithm,

323
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,680
one that essentially guides the mouse as if it had blinders on.

324
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,510


325
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,760
- Normally, if you're going
along the side of a wall,

326
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,930
or something like that,

327
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,630
most of the time you can
see the wall all the time.

328
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,450
And so that helps you to guide yourself,

329
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,310
and you know when you're getting off.

330
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,260
But in the diagonal situation,

331
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,360
you just see these walls coming at you.

332
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,300
- [Derek] And if you veer
even a tiny bit off course,

333
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,400
snagging a corner is a lot less forgiving

334
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,320
than sliding against a wall.

335
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,390
Diagonals are still one
of the biggest sources

336
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,373
of crashes in competition today.

337
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,300
But in exchange, a jagged path of turns transforms into one narrow straightaway.

338
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,421
transforms into one narrow straightaway.

339
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:37,483
- [Commentator] Oh!

340
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,382
Whoa!
(audience applauding)

341
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:42,391
(audience applauding)

342
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,250
(audience cheering)

343
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,800
- [Derek] These days, nearly
every competitive Micromouse

344
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,873
is designed to take this risk.

345
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,700
Cutting diagonals opened up
room for even more ideas.

346
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,780
Around the same time,

347
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,810
mice were applying similar
strategies to turning.

348
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,870
Instead of stopping and pivoting
through two right turns,

349
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,110
a mouse could sweep around
in a single U-turn motion.

350
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,540
And once the possibility
of diagonals were added,

351
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,530
the total number of possible
turns opened up exponentially.

352
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,220
The maze was no longer just
a grid of square hallways.

353
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,620
With so many more options to weigh,

354
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,370
figuring out the best path
became more complex than ever.

355
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,350
But the payoff was dramatic.

356
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,450
What was once a series of stops and starts could now be a single,fluid, snaking motion.

357
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,270
could now be a single,fluid, snaking motion.

358
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,880
How Micromice imagined
and moved through the maze

359
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,545
had changed completely.

360
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:34,545
(audience cheering)

361
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,740
Available technology was getting upgrades

362
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,390
over the years as well.

363
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,390
Tall and unwieldy arms that
were used to find walls

364
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,280
were replaced by a smaller array

365
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,920
of infrared sensors on board the mouse.

366
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,690
Precise stepper motors were traded in

367
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,390
for continuous DC motors and encoders.

368
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,160
- The DC motors give you more power

369
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,720
for less size and weight,

370
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,310
and so we were interested in doing that.

371
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,110
So then you have to have a servo.

372
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,510
You have to actually have
feedback on the motor

373
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,010
to make it do the right thing.

374
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,043
- [Derek] Gyroscopes added an
extra sense of orientation.

375
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,627
It's like a compass, if you
had this thing with you.

376
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,960
- They came about cause
of mobile phones, really.

377
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,859
so the technology provides people

378
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,539
with things which weren't there before.

379
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,839
All of the turning is
done based off the gyro

380
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,479
rather than counting
pulses off the wheels,

381
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,040
because it's much more reliable.

382
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,200
- [Derek] But even with all
the mechanical upgrades,

383
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,060
the biggest physical issue for Micromice

384
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,220
went unaddressed for decades.

385
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,710
One thing you'll see almost
every competitor holding

386
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,540
is a roll of tape.

387
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,240
Once you know to look for
it, you'll see it everywhere.

388
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,080
This tape isn't for repairs
or reattaching fallen parts.

389
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,910
It's to gather specs of dust

390
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,400
off the wheels in between rounds.

391
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,100
At the speed and precision
these robots are operating,

392
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,063
that tiny change in friction
is enough to ruin a run.

393
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,440
If you wanna turn while driving fast,

394
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,250
you need centripetal force to
accelerate you into the turn.

395
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,540
And the faster you're moving,

396
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,690
the more force you need
to keep you on the track.

397
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,640
The only centripetal force for a car

398
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,160
turning on flat ground is friction,

399
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,140
which is determined by two things,

400
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,360
the road pushing up the weight of the car,

401
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,590
or the normal force,

402
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,020
multiplied by the static
coefficient of friction,

403
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,670
which is the friction of the interface

404
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,950
between the tire and road surface.

405
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,710
This is why racetracks have banked turns.

406
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,950
The steep angles help cars
turn with less friction,

407
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,280
because part of the normal
force itself now points in

408
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,130
to contribute to the
centripetal force required.

409
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,720
If the banked turn is steep enough,

410
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,260
cars can actually make the turn
without any friction at all.

411
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,960
The inward component of the
normal force alone is enough

412
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,282
to provide the centripetal
force required to stay on track.

413
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:44,880
(upbeat music)

414
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,470
Micromice are no different,

415
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,170
and they don't have banked turns to help.

416
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,200
As they got faster and
faster, by the early 2000s,

417
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,660
their limiting factor was no longer speed,

418
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,790
but control of that speed.

419
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,250
They had to set their
center of gravity low,

420
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,870
and slow down during turns

421
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,320
to avoid slipping into
a wall or flipping over.

422
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,870
But unlike race cars, there
wasn't anything in the rules

423
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,810
to stop Micromouse competitors
from solving this problem

424
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,693
by engineering an entirely new mechanism.

425
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,740
Micromouse's second Fosbury flop

426
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,300
was almost considered a gimmick

427
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,140
when the mouse Mokomo08
first used it in competition.

428
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,540
You might be staring at
the video to try to see it,

429
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,650
but you won't.

430
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,980
Instead, it's something you'll hear.

431
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,900
(Micromouse whirring)

432
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,820
That isn't the mouse revving its engines.

433
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,160
It's spinning up a propeller.

434
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,220
And while flying over the
walls is against the rules,

435
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,900
there's nothing in the
rules against a mouse

436
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,690
vacuuming itself to the
ground to prevent slipping.

437
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,820
- Dave Otten was the first person

438
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,890
I saw put a fan on a mouse,

439
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,810
but he used a ducted fan,

440
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,750
and I think he was really looking
at kind of reaction force,

441
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,220
you know, blowing the thing down.

442
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,220
He had a skirt around, but it
was not terribly effective.

443
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,090
Forgive me for saying this, though.

444
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,530
The idea is to let as
little air in as possible.

445
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,790
And like your vacuum cleaner,

446
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,470
when you block your vacuum cleaner, right,

447
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:11,340
the motor unloads and speeds
up, and so the current drops.

448
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,430
But if you let too much air
in, the current's very high.

449
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,740
And these are just quadcopter motors,

450
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,150
and they draw a lot of current.

451
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,940
- [Derek] At the scale of
Micromouse, a vacuum fan,

452
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,030
often just built from
handheld drone parts,

453
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,280
is enough to generate a downward force

454
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,473
five times the mouse's weight.

455
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,813
Wow. Okay.

456
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,880
That's impressive.

457
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,950
So how much does the car actually weigh?

458
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,780
- About 130 grams.

459
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,989
And if you listen,

460
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,879
I don't know if you'll get
it on your microphone, but-

461
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:40,830
(motor whirring)

462
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,153
- Oh yeah.
- you can hear

463
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:45,300
the motors slow down, and it loads up.

464
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,860
- [Derek] With that much friction,

465
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,780
Micromice today can turn corners

466
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,440
with a centripetal acceleration
approaching six Gs.

467
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,624
That's the same as F1 cars.

468
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:58,080
(engines revving)

469
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,450
Once nearly everyone equipped fans,

470
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,250
the added control allowed builders

471
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,410
to push the speed limit on Micromice.

472
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,610
- When it's allowed to,

473
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,190
it will out-accelerate a Tesla Roadster,

474
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,611
but not for very far.

475
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,444
(Derek laughs)

476
00:21:10,444 --> 00:21:11,550
- [Derek] And they can zip along

477
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,650
at up to seven meters per second,

478
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,703
faster than most people can run.

479
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,918
(audience laughing)

480
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:22,085
(Micromouse whirring)

481
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:32,931
(audience cheering)

482
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,800
Every one of the features now standard

483
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,410
on the modern Micromouse
was once an experiment,

484
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,770
and the next Fosbury flop
might not be far off.

485
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,570
The first four-wheeled Micromouse

486
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,680
to win the All Japan
competition did so in 1988,

487
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,600
but it would take another 22 years

488
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,270
of the winning mouse growing
and losing appendages

489
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,390
before four-wheeled mice became the norm.

490
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,370
With Micromice still experimenting

491
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,260
in six- and eight-wheel designs,

492
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,200
omnidirectional movement,
and even computer vision,

493
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,810
who knows what the next
paradigm shift will be?

494
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,000
- [Commentator] Your time
on the maze actually begins

495
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,397
only when you leave the start square,

496
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,493
so he's not penalized
for any of this time.

497
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,560
- [Derek] But if you wanna
get started with Micromouse,

498
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,500
you don't need to worry about
wheel count or vacuum fans,

499
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,180
or even diagonals.

500
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,730
- It is, to my mind,
the perfect combination

501
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,270
of all the major disciplines that you need

502
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,140
for robotics and
engineering and programming,

503
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,640
embedded systems,

504
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,220
all wrapped up in one accessible bundle

505
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,020
that you can do in your living room,

506
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,460
and you don't need a laboratory to run it.

507
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:49,717
You come along because you're
curious, and then you think,

508
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:52,380
"I could do that. That
doesn't look so hard."

509
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,700
And then you're doomed, really.

510
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,622
If it sucks you in, it turns
into quite the journey.

511
00:22:57,622 --> 00:23:01,872
(commentator speaking in Japanese)

512
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:11,404
(audience cheering)

513
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,353
- [Derek] At its core,

514
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:19,530
Micromouse is just about a
mouse trying to solve a maze.

515
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,000
Though, nearly 50 years later,

516
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,760
it's a simple problem
that's a good reminder,

517
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,613
there is no such thing
as a simple problem.

- If you wanna build your own Micromouse,

524
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,620
you'll likely need to design parts

525
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,350
using a 3D CAD program like Onshape,

526
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,180
the sponsor of this video.

527
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,910
Onshape is a modern CAD plus PDM system

528
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,170
designed for businesses,

529
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,220
and completely free for
makers and hobbyists to use.

530
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,070
Any serious hardware product
needs a precise design

531
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,860
in order to be successfully
made in the real world,

532
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,110
from a Micromouse model like this one

533
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,830
to a professional V2
engine model like this one.

534
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,300
Unlike traditional CAD programs,

535
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,160
which are installed on premises,

536
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,590
Onshape was built entirely in the cloud,

537
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,330
which allows engineering and design teams

538
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,610
to collaborate like never before.

539
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,190
Onshape allows you to
work together in real time

540
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,380
on the same design with multiple users,

541
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,850
just like Google Docs.

542
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,530
This completely eliminates the need

543
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,540
for emailing large files back and forth

544
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,120
and trying to keep track of who
has the most recent version,

545
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,180
whether it's V2 or V22.

546
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,130
With Onshape, Agile methodologies

547
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,780
that are common in software development

548
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,420
are now being adopted
in hardware development

549
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,630
to allow companies to build
better products faster.

550
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,400
Onshape's not only great for businesses,

551
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,050
but also for open source projects,

552
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,420
or just working on
designs with your friends.

553
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,490
Again, it's totally free for hobbyists,

554
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,070
so you can try it out for
yourself as much as you like

555
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,010
at onshape.pro/veritasium.

556
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,530
You can take Onshape
with you wherever you go.

557
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,270
You don't need a powerful desktop

558
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,430
or a specific operating system to run it.

559
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,260
Whether you're on a Mac or PC,

560
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,650
or even just on your phone,
you can easily use Onshape.

561
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,270
So to get started, sign up for free

562
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,820
at onshape.pro/veritasium.

563
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,920
I wanna thank Onshape for
sponsoring this video,

564
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,813
and I wanna thank you for watching.
