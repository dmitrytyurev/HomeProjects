1
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:32,250
Radiation is frightening.

2
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,480
At least, certain types of it are.

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,519
I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near
my mobile phone, or the Wi-Fi router or my

4
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:40,519
microwave.

5
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,370
That’s because a Geiger counter only measures
ionizing radiation — that is, radiation

6
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,800
with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms.

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,329
And it’s measured in units called sieverts.

8
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,399
If you're exposed to more than two sieverts
all at once you'll probably die shortly after

9
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,399
that.

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,370
But we’re exposed to low levels of ionizing
radiation all the time.

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,890
Bananas for example are rich in potassium
and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive.

12
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:12,759
So when you eat a banana you're actually exposed
to about 0.1 microsieverts of radiation.

13
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,399
That’s one ten millionth of a sievert.

14
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:19,400
Let’s use a banana for scale of radiation
doses.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,409
You know, since people eat bananas we become
radioactive too.

16
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,820
So you're actually exposed to more radiation
if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,350
alone.

18
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,450
But I wouldn't worry about that because that
dose is insignificant compared to the natural

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,640
background radiation of earth.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,870
I mean there’s ionizing radiation coming
out of the soil in the rocks, in the air,

21
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,750
and even from space.

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,110
The level of radiation here in Sydney is about
.15 microsieverts per hour, and that's about

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,290
average globally.

24
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,080
The level’s usually between .1 and .2 microsieverts
per hour.

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,500
But there are places with significantly higher
levels.

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,960
So who on earth do you think receives the
maximum dose of ionizing radiation?

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,020
Let’s answer that question by going to the
most radioactive places on earth.

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,899
Some places you’d expect to have high levels
of radiation might surprise you.

29
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,940
I’m in Hiroshima and that is the Peace Dome.

30
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,170
It was about 600 meters above that dome where
the worlds first nuclear bomb was detonated

31
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,189
over a city.

32
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,730
It was detonated there to have maximum destructive
impact.

33
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,060
Well the level of radiation today almost 70
years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,060
hour.

35
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,170
I'm about to get into an elevator.

36
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,120
We're going down in a mineshaft.

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,880
This is an old uranium mine.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,860
This is the mine where uranium was discovered.

39
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,820
It's also the place where Marie Curie obtained
her raw material.

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,890
1.7 microsieverts per hour.

41
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,550
That's about 10 times the natural background
that you would have.

42
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,220
Nowadays most of the uranium has been removed.

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,840
But in this wall there’s still a small piece
and you can see under UV light it floresces.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,450
Look at that.

45
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,920
Fluorescent uranium ore.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,920
This is the lab of Marie Curie.

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,360
She won two Nobel prizes, one in physics and
one in chemistry.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,650
And she conducted a lot of her work here.

49
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,629
And this is her office.

50
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:33,550
She would have sat right there.

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,459
Apparently there are only a few parts of this
area which are still radioactive.

52
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,780
One is this doorknob.

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,510
Well it climbs not not much but — But that's
like 10 times the background.

54
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,040
Yeah.

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,230
More than 10.

56
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,550
And another is the back of her chair.

57
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,730
You can still detect alpha particles coming
off this spot right here.

58
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,150
Apparently after she was working in the lab
she would come, oopen the door leaving traces

59
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,520
of radium here and then go and pull out her
chair.

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,880
Welcome to New Mexico.

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,739
This is the Trinity bomb test site where the
world’s first nuclear bomb was set off.

62
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,000
Right here.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,970
Right in the spot.

64
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,960
This whole area was vaporized.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,660
In fact, there was so much heat liberated
by that bomb that it fused all of the desert

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,520
sand into this green glass.

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,720
And you can still find it here.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,580
They've actually named this mineral after
the test.

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,199
It's called Trinitite.

70
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,440
Yeah.

71
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,180
This is the only place on earth that this
has ever been made.

72
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,229
The level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts
an hour.

73
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,080
The Trinitite itself is a little bit more
radioactive.

74
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,330
I got readings of two or three microsieverts
an hour off them.

75
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,560
Now which place has higher levels of radiation
then anywhere we've seen so far?

76
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,319
The answer is an airplane.

77
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,589
You know, as you gain altitude there's less
atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic

78
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,589
rays.

79
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,530
So the level of radiation inside the plane
can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at

80
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,249
18,000 feet, up to one microsievert per hour
at 23,000 feet, over two microsieverts per

81
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:28,770
hour at 30,000 feet, and over three microsieverts
per hour at even higher altitudes and towards

82
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,210
the poles.

83
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:41,969
That is Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.

84
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:46,020
It melted down on April 26, 1986.

85
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,259
So, what happened was so much heat was generated
inside that reactor that it basically blew

86
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:59,089
the top off spreading radioactive isotopes
throughout this whole surrounding area and

87
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,369
over into Europe.

88
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:03,629
And that is why we can still detect the contamination
here today.

89
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,969
Now, right now it's reading around five microsieverts
an hour.

90
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:12,980
If I stayed here for one hour my body would
receive a similar dose to what you’d receive

91
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,240
when you get a dental x-ray.

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,639
So this is not a huge amount of radiation.

93
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,380
And one of the reasons why the radiation level
is not too high is because they actually removed

94
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,310
a couple meters worth of topsoil from this
whole area, then they dumped it somewhere.

95
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,129
That's why we can stand here.

96
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:39,300
We're driving into the Fukushima exclusion
zone now.

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,460
I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger
counter go up as we approach the zone.

98
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,939
See those black bags at the side of the road?

99
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:53,099
The Japanese are doing now exactly what the
people in Chernobyl did, collecting up meters

100
00:06:53,099 --> 00:07:17,319
and meters of topsoil.

101
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,449
The mask is probably overkill.

102
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,639
It's just to stop radioactive dust from getting
into my lungs.

103
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,889
This is definitely one of the most radioactive
places where I've been.

104
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:34,720
Even though the release of radioactive material
was less than Chernobyl, only about 10%, because

105
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,949
it's much fresher—only three years since
the accident— much less of it has decayed.

106
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,699
So I've been getting readings up around 5
to 10 microsieverts an hour.

107
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,710
And I think we won't be staying here for too
long because of that.

108
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,990
I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat.

109
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:02,659
And this is where the firemen were taken after
they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor.

110
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:08,219
And in the basement of this building they
have left all the firemen's clothing.

111
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:13,669
Once they realize it was so contaminated they chucked it down there.

112
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:35,610
(Inaudible) But you can see there's a huge
pile of their gear there.

113
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,480
Right outside the door I'm getting 500 microsieverts
an hour just outside the door.

114
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,060
One thousand five hundred microsieverts an
hour.

115
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,060
You know if we stayed here for a couple hours
we’d receive our annual dose of background

116
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,430
radiation.

117
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,160
That basement was the most radioactive place
I visited and it's one of the most radioactive

118
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
places on earth.

119
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,769
If I'd stayed down there for one hour I would’ve
received 2000 microsieverts.

120
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,079
That's a years worth of natural background
radiation.

121
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,839
Every yellow pixel here represents a banana.

122
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,120
Now that might seem like a lot, but consider
that in a CT scan the patient receives about

123
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,410
7000 microsieverts.

124
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,769
That's three years worth of natural backround
radiation.

125
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,899
It's been estimated that the people living
around Fukushima will receive an additional

126
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,190
10,000 microsieverts over their lifetime due
to the nuclear power disaster.

127
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:36,879
For comparison US radiation workers are limited
to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year.

128
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,830
But that's less than another occupation.

129
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,209
Astronaut.

130
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:46,170
An astronaut on the space station for six
months will receive about 80,000 microsieverts

131
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,920
worth of radiation.

132
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,230
But not even they are exposed to the highest
levels of ionizing radiation.

133
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,910
So can you guess who is?

134
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,079
The answer is a smoker’s lungs.

135
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:04,759
A smoker’s lungs on average receive 160,000
microsieverts worth of radiation every year.

136
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,830
That's due to the radioactive polonium and
radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're

137
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,830
smoking.

138
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,639
So not only are they exposed to carcinogens
and toxins they also receive very high levels

139
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,320
of radiation.

140
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,310
So it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl
or radiation workers or even astronauts that

141
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,509
receive the highest dosage of ionizing radiation.

142
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:30,389
That honor goes to your ordinary average smoker.

143
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:33,889
Hey.

144
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,189
As you can see over the last few months I've
been traveling around the world actually filming

145
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:38,899
a documentary for television.

146
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,850
It should be on in the middle of next year.

147
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,370
But being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima
reminded me of this book The Day of the Triffids

148
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,000
and it's about a post-apocalyptic world in
which plants take over.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,540
I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's
actually a brilliant book so you should really

150
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,810
check it out if you're looking for something
to do over the holidays.

151
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,120
Now you can download this book for free by
going to audible.com/Veritasium or you can

152
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,660
pick any other book of your choosing for a
one month free trial.

153
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,290
Audible is a great audiobook website with
over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature

154
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,250
including fiction, nonfiction, and periodicals.

155
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,949
So I really want to thank audible for supporting
me and I want to thank you for watching.
