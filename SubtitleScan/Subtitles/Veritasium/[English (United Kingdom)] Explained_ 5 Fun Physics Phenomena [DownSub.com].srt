00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,640
- In my last video I showed you five fun physics
phenomena and asked you how they work.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,200
You responded with thousands of comments and
some video responses.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,559
Well here are my explanations.

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,030
Let's start with the cereal because it seems
the simplest but it turns out to be one of

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,770
the most surprising.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,770
The simple explanation goes like this.

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,040
So, I showed you cereal is magnetic.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,890
I have ground up all of this cereal into a
very fine powder.

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,050
Let us see what is in it.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,430
I'm going to take these strong magnets and
run them over the cereal powder and see if

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,870
anything is attracted to them.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,690
Look how the cereal actually sticks to the
magnet.

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,410
And it's because there's pieces of iron in
this cereal.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,210
They've been added because iron is something
we need, it's an essential nutrient that we

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,210
need to survive.

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,330
In fact, this cereal has 60% of your recommended daily intake of iron.

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,530
But there's more to it.

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:03,040
I received a video response from Maarten Baert
showing non-magnetic objects like plastic

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,610
and paper also apparently being attracted
to a magnet.

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,830
So, how does this work?

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,750
Well water is diamagnetic, which means in
the presence of a magnetic field it generates

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,830
its own magnetic field in the opposite direction.

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,560
This means the water is very slightly repelled
by the magnet and this causes a depression

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,620
in the surface of the water into which a floating
object will slide.

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,000
You can even see this depression by looking
at the reflections off the water.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,430
So cereal is attracted to a magnet due to
its iron content but when floating on the

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,080
surface of water there is an additional effect,
the depression of the water's surface due

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,160
to its diamagnetism.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,240
I showed you that you can find the center
of mass of a cane or another stick-type object

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,400
just by moving your fingers in towards the
middle from the outside.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,970
But how does this work, even when you start,
in say, an asymmetric position?

32
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,229
Well, one finger is closer to the center of
mass and therefore it carries more of the

33
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,200
weight of the cane, and so the friction force
between your finger and the cane is greater

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,030
until the point where the other finger catches
up at which point this finger slides in and

35
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,950
eventually they must meet in the middle.

36
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,230
So this a way you can find the center of mass
of any cane or cane-like object.

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,650
I showed you that if you trt to flip your
phone end over end, there is no way to do

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,870
it without it also rotating around the short
axis as well.

39
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,980
Why is that?

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,240
The phone has three axes about which it can
rotate.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,780
There is the long axis, which has the maximum
moment of inertia, meaning it requires the

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,120
most torque to accelerate it in that direction.

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,730
Spinning about the short axis has the least
moment of inertia.

44
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,620
Then there is the intermediate axis which
has a moment of inertia in between the other

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
two.

46
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,610
Now the intermediate axis theorem says that
if you try to flip any object along its intermediate

47
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,980
axis it will not maintain simply that rotation,
it will also get rotations in any of the other

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
directions.

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,750
That is, if there is any slight deviation
from a perfect rotation.

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,769
So why does this happen?

51
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,360
Well, the mathematics is kinda complicated
but it's similar to the mathematics of a rigid

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
pendulum.

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,330
So, if you're flipping the phone along its
long axis or its short axis the phone acts

54
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,130
a little bit like this pendulum in that any
perturbation will cause it simply to go back

55
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,790
to where it was before.

56
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,610
But, if you're flipping it along its intermediate
axis it's as though you're trying to balance

57
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,629
the pendulum on its end, in which case it's
very unstable and any slight perturbation

58
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,010
may cause it to exponentially increase.

59
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,590
So that is why you can't just flip your phone
along its intermediate axis without it also

60
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,069
spinning along one of the other axes.

61
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:54,120
I showed you that an electrically charged
object can deflect a stream of water.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,090
But it is not due to the common explanation,
the common reason which is given, which is

63
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,370
that water is a polar molecule.

64
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,239
So what really is causing this water to be
attracted towards the cup?

65
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,230
Well, it is charges, but it is ions, it is
dissolved ions in the water.

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,409
There will be some OH ions, some H+ ions and
there'll also be some other impurity ions

67
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:17,560
in the water.

68
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,689
So what happens when you hold this negatively
charged cup up against the water's stream

69
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,819
is it will repel the negative charges, the
negative ions in the water, some of which

70
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,540
will go back up into the tap.

71
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,460
And that means the water coming down will
be slightly positively charged.

72
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,159
And once it breaks up into droplets those
droplets have a positive charge that they

73
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:41,180
can't get rid of, so now those positive droplets
are attracted to the negatively charged cup.

74
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,789
And you can see those droplets swirling around the cup because they are so attracted to it.

75
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:51,490
So this is not actually a very good demonstration
of the polar nature of water.

76
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,659
Even non-polar substances with some ions dissolved
in them will deflect in exactly this way.

77
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,990
So this is actually showing us that water
droplets are charged, they are charged by

78
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,259
induction, and it is not due to the polar
nature of water that they are attracted to

79
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,580
electrically charged objects.

80
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,259
Now you know.

81
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:15,099
In the teabag rocket we showed that if you
light a teabag on fire from the top it will

82
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,719
actually take off into the air.

83
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:23,389
That happens because as the teabag is burning
all the air inside it heats up and so it expands

84
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,990
so it gets less dense and it's pushed up by
all the cooler air around it.

85
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,099
You know, sometimes people talk about how
hot air rises.

86
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,300
I mean, that is what hot air does, but only
because the cooler air around it is pushing

87
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
it up.

88
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,219
In essence it's like a buoyant force because
the hot air is now less dense than the cooler

89
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,319
air around it.

90
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,819
So, when the teabag burns right down to the
bottom the remaining ash is so light that

91
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:52,080
it gets swept up in that convection current,
and you get a teabag rocket.

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,289
So do you agree with all of my explanations,
and did you get them right the first time?

93
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,159
Let me know in the comments and thanks for
watching.
