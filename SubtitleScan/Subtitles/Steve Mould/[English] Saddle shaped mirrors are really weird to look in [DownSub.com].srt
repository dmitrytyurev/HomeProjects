1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
- This mirror is convex and
concave at the same time.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,760
So what's it like to
look into this mirror?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,670
We all know what it's like
to look into a convex mirror,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,140
like this security mirror.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,030
It creates a sort of fisheye effect.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,770
And if you've ever looked
into a makeup mirror,

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,840
you'll know what it's like
to see your reflection

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,280
from a concave surface.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,990
It magnifies your face.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,570
Or you know, just look at the
front and back of a spoon,

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,129
though it's interesting
that this concave mirror

12
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,290
magnifies your face, while this one

13
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,670
turns your face upside down.

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,780
We'll need to figure that out.

15
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,359
What I'm actually showing
you here is what it's like

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,729
to be a camera looking into
concave and convex mirrors.

17
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,590
But for this video, I
want you to experience

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,810
what it's like to be a person looking into

19
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,250
all these different types of mirrors,

20
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,840
so I stuck my phone to the inside

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,580
of this Arnold Schwarzenegger mask.

22
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,070
So this is what it's like
to be Arnold Schwarzenegger

23
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,160
looking into a concave mirror
and this is what it's like

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,650
to be Arnold Schwarzenegger
looking into a convex mirror.

25
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,450
But what's it like to
be Arnold Schwarzenegger

26
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,980
looking into a mirror that's convex

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,050
and concave at the same time?

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,850
What do I even mean by that?

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,850
Well, I'm talking about a
mirror that has a saddle point,

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,280
and just from the name, you
probably already have an idea

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,780
what I'm talking about.

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,420
I don't have a saddle for
illustration purposes,

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,450
but I do have a Pringle,
and a Pringle is a saddle,

34
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,010
from a mathematical point of view

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,320
and only a mathematical point of view.

36
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,180
This is the saddle point of the Pringle

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,360
and if you travel left or
right away from that point,

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,160
the height of the Pringle goes down.

39
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,860
In other words, the
saddle point is a maxima,

40
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,848
but if I rotate the
Pringle and do it again,

41
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,840
traveling left or right
away from the saddle point,

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,880
the height of the Pringle goes up.

43
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,620
In other words, this point is a minima.

44
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,500
So depending on which plane
through the Pringle you choose,

45
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,290
the saddle point is either
a maxima or a minima,

46
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,790
but when you take the shape as a whole,

47
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,350
it's neither of those things.

48
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,310
But for the purposes of
experiencing a mirror of this shape,

49
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,590
well, it's concave in this direction

50
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,720
and convex in this direction.

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,250
I was trying to figure out how the hell

52
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,110
do you make a saddle-shaped mirror,

53
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,790
and then I came across this video

54
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,860
on the AlphaPhoenix channel about putting

55
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,980
a mirrored surface on 3D
prints, so I asked him

56
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,350
if he'd be interested in
working on it together

57
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,150
and this is what he came up with.

58
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,160
Actually, it doesn't
involve 3D printing at all.

59
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,650
It's really clever actually,
and if you wanna find out

60
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,050
how it's done, I recommend
you watch his video

61
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,910
on the subject, but actually check out

62
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,760
the whole AlphaPhoenix channel,
because it's incredible.

63
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,950
The link is in the card
and the description there.

64
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,140
So this is what it's like
to be Arnold Schwarzenegger

65
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,330
looking into a saddle-shaped mirror.

66
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,730
As I rotate the mirror,
the direction of stretch

67
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,130
also rotates, but the image itself

68
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,900
never ends up inverted.

69
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,550
I found that quite surprising initially,

70
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,640
because the mirror's
concave in one direction,

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,520
and concave mirrors flip
images, but then I realized

72
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,310
this mirror is acting
like a makeup mirror.

73
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,470
The concave axis is magnifying the image

74
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,570
in that direction instead of flipping it.

75
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,754
So how can I get this
thing to act like a spoon

76
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:47,610
and invert the image in the concave axis?

77
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,070
Well, it's all to do with the
location of the focal point.

78
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,370
If the head is between the
mirror and the focal point

79
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,810
of the mirror, then the head is magnified.

80
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,960
If the focal point is between
the mirror and the head,

81
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,850
then the head is flipped.

82
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,490
With this mirror, the focal
point is somewhere out here,

83
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,220
and if I tried to film from
outside the focal point,

84
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,390
it just wouldn't work.

85
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,410
It's too small.

86
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,720
You wouldn't be able to see
any of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

87
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,360
So what I need to do is
bring the focal point

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,590
closer to the mirror.

89
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,820
In other words, I need
to make the curvature

90
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,360
of the mirror more
extreme, and fortunately,

91
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,010
this mirror is adjustable.

92
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,990
But then we run into a slight issue.

93
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,630
When you try to do that
with, say, a playing card,

94
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,460
you actually don't get a saddle point.

95
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,890
You get either a trough in this direction

96
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,450
or a trough in this direction,

97
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,010
and you can flip between the two.

98
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,840
If you try hard enough, you can end up

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,850
with this situation where two corners

100
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,250
are pointing up and two
corners are pointing down,

101
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,740
but then you've got this
flat region in the middle.

102
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,920
An acrylic sheet is more
elastic than a playing card,

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,490
so this isn't an issue
for shallow curvatures,

104
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,140
but when I try to increase the curvature,

105
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,620
you end up with one axis
more curved than the other

106
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,080
and you have this slight
flat region in the middle.

107
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,360
Andrew Dubinsky and
Michael Barson also offered

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,970
to make me a saddle-shaped
mirror and I'm hugely grateful

109
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,140
for what they've produced.

110
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,340
They used a different method.

111
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,610
The traditional way to make
a saddle point mathematically

112
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,120
is to construct a surface
called a hyperbolic paraboloid.

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,030
The equation for that
is Z equals X times Y,

114
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,860
which makes intuitive sense.

115
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,160
If X and Y are both
positive or both negative,

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,790
then Z is positive, which
pulls these two corners up,

117
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,420
but if X is positive and y
is negative or vice versa,

118
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,630
then Z is negative, which
pulls these two corners down.

119
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,920
But one thing that's really surprising

120
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,630
about a hyperbolic paraboloid is that

121
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,300
it can be constructed
using only straight lines.

122
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,700
You can see that here in these two sweeps.

123
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,830
Look, you've got straight
lines in this plane

124
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,660
and straight lines in this plane.

125
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,460
With that in mind, when Andrew and Michael

126
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,950
came across a bamboo
placemat, they realized

127
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,810
they might have the perfect beginnings

128
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,610
of a hyperbolic paraboloid mirror.

129
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,860
You see, the strips of bamboo constrained

130
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,320
those straight lines, but with a twist,

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,180
we can get that saddle point.

132
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,880
You can see here how they
created a cardboard frame

133
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,130
to lock it in the
saddle-point configuration.

134
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,500
Then by heating sheets of PETG above

135
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,030
the plastic transition temperature,

136
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,330
they could lay that over the
top and then clamp it down

137
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,670
with a similarly-manufactured top plate.

138
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,850
Once cooled, the sheet
of PETG would be smoother

139
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,590
than the surface it cooled on.

140
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,230
Then that became the surface that the next sheet is molded to.

141
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,250


142
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,980
Each step makes the surface
smoother and smoother

143
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,890
than the original bamboo,
and this is what we have.

144
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,910
So there's definitely a trade off

145
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,760
between these two methods of
making a saddle-shaped mirror.

146
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,920
You can achieve a greater
curvature with this one,

147
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,050
but it's a little more wobbly.

148
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,690
It's interesting to see how even very minor wobbles in the surface can distort the reflection so much.

149
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,660


150
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,670
I mean, I should've known,
that given that I made

151
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,160
two videos on the subject,
one about caustics

152
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,200
and one about Chinese magic mirrors.

153
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,120
Link in the card and the
description for them.

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,310
So now that the focal point is between

155
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,800
Arnold Schwarzenegger and the mirror,

156
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,840
look what happens when
I rotate the mirror.

157
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,010
The head ends up on its side at one point,

158
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,843
which is quite surprising.

159
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,360
When the mirror is positioned like this,

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,330
with that concave axis at 45 degrees,

161
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,390
then you're flipping the
image in this direction.

162
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,370
Look what happens when
I do that in Photoshop.

163
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,860
Here's the flip, and
that quite intuitively

164
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,720
puts the image on its side.

165
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,670
The mirror's convex in this direction,

166
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,880
so the image is squished
in this direction.

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,680
Shrinking the image in this direction

168
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,540
is what skews the image.

169
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,280
That focal point actually
does something brilliant

170
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,380
to the rays of light hitting the mirror.

171
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,420
Andrew and Michael used a laser line

172
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,190
and a fog machine to illustrate this.

173
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,890
See, there's a focal
point, but as you rotate

174
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,810
the laser line around, the focal point

175
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,570
kind of untwists itself as it moves

176
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,180
from the concave plane
to the convex plane.

177
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,961
How cool is that?

178
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,900
By the way, it's fiendishly
difficult to keep the subject

179
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,990
in the mirror when you're
watching a mirrored version

180
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,750
of your phone filming a mirror
that behaves differently

181
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,300
when you tilt it, depending on how it's oriented, and it's constantly overheating, because you've stuffed the head to stop it collapsing.


182
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,500


183
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,660


184
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,480
Which leads me to the
third saddle-shaped mirror,

185
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,810
which I commissioned animator
peak Pete McPartland to make.

186
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,850
With this, there's no
fiddling about with masks

187
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,140
and cameras and everything.

188
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,480
You just put a 3D model of a head in there

189
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,340
and stick the camera inside the head,

190
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,250
and I can easily adjust the
parameters of the mirror.

191
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,810
So there's lots to play with here,

192
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,480
but first, as this is rendered digitally,

193
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,570
we can explore a little bit of
the mathematics of the curve.

194
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,570
It's really cool to look at a
contour map of a saddle point.

195
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,370
Look, as I cut through the mirror,

196
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,370
these two curves are hyperbolas, and look,

197
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,410
when you get to this point, they touch

198
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,180
and you end up with a cross, and actually,

199
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,160
that's true of all saddle points.

200
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,950
Every saddle point has
contour lines that cross.

201
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,200
Interestingly, a hyperbolic
paraboloid can also

202
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,820
be formed with the
equation Z equals X squared

203
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,524
minus Y squared.

204
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,010
Look, you can see there's
the X squared curve

205
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,060
and there it is sweeping over
the minus Y squared curve.

206
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,340
So this is what happens
when you approach the mirror

207
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,260
but don't go past the focal point.

208
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,000
Your face basically stretches out.

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,980
Then if you carry on past the focal point,

210
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,690
your face unstretches again.

211
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,880
That's counterintuitive
to me, but actually,

212
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,430
if we rotate the mirror through 45 degrees

213
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,010
so that the concave axis is vertical,

214
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,610
we can see that the face
starts flipped top to bottom,

215
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,470
and when you pass through the focal point,

216
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,900
it comes back 'round to the right way up.

217
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,510
And so actually what you're
seeing in this orientation

218
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,390
is the face flipped
horizontally and then unflipping

219
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,190
when you go through the focal point.

220
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,490
You also see copies of the face
creeping in from the sides.

221
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,520
It might be more correct to
say that those side faces

222
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,590
replace the middle face, as opposed

223
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,020
to the middle face flipping,
and that's a brand new sentence

224
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,220
that's never been said before.

225
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,780
I used an iPhone to take a scan

226
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,090
of my face so I could
put that in the render.

227
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,429
It's not a great quality
model, but it's interesting

228
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,732
that you can use an iPhone's
face ID tech in this way.

229
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,390
Here's what happens when you
move your head up and down,

230
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,210
and when you move your head side to side,

231
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,490
and for completeness and because we can,

232
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,980
here's what happens when
the mirror slowly flattens

233
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,663
and then goes the other way.

234
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,250
Probably the ultimate
way to make a physical

235
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,310
saddle-shaped mirror would be with CNC.

236
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,130
There are some significant
complications with that.

237
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,230
A lot of it's to do with
the time and expense

238
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,260
of finishing the surface,
though because the saddle shape

239
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,570
is made of straight lines,
you could potentially

240
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,760
make this thing using wire EDM.

241
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,760
Link in the card and description
to my video about wire EDM.

242
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,220
But potentially you could
have a really nice surface

243
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,910
after the cut that doesn't need
a huge amount of finishing.

244
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,460
If that ever happens, I'll
make a follow-up video.

245
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,673
I will watch any movie
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.

246
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,407
"Terminator," "Terminator 2," "Twins."

247
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,720
Here's the thing, though.

248
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,210
I've never seen "Conan the Barbarian,"

249
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,250
even though it's on
Netflix, and that's because

250
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,770
it's not on Netflix in the UK.

251
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,740
Brilliantly, if I search for,
"Conan the," Netflix shows me

252
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,630
this show called "Barbarians."

253
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,620
It knows what I want.

254
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,090
It's just not giving it to me.

255
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,070
But it is available in the U.S.,

256
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,480
so if I turn on a U.S.
location in Surfshark VPN,

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,220
the sponsor of this video, and then look,

258
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,430
I go back to Netflix, and
there's "Conan the Barbarian!"

259
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,270
Yay!

260
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,840
A VPN encrypts all the web
traffic leaving your device,

261
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,660
meaning that nobody on your Wi-Fi network,

262
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,640
nobody at your internet service provider,

263
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,590
nobody in your government,
if that's something

264
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,600
you need to worry about, is able to see

265
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
the websites that you visit.

266
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,530
Typically, they wouldn't
be able to see the content

267
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,040
of the websites you visit,
because most websites use HTTPS,

268
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,590
but they would still be
able to see the domain names

269
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,140
that you visit if you didn't use a VPN.

270
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,030
If that's important to
you, then that's another

271
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,260
use case scenario.

272
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,630
To flip the Netflix use case on its head,

273
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,230
I was in France recently and
it was a real pain in the arse

274
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,590
to do any kind of life
admin, because any website

275
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,410
that I visited while I was
there wanted to redirect me

276
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,460
to the French version, but
by switching Surfshark VPN

277
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,080
to a UK IP address, everything
worked as if I was at home.

278
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,250
That's just a couple of use cases.

279
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,083
What else to say?

280
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,010
Once Surfshark account can be used

281
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,540
on an unlimited number of devices.

282
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,550
There's a 30-day money back guarantee,

283
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,070
which means you can try
absolutely risk free.

284
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,200
If you're interested, then
there's a great promotion

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,660
on this one.

286
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,120
If you go to surfshark.deals/stevemould,

287
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,610
you'll get three extra
months absolutely free.

288
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,050
