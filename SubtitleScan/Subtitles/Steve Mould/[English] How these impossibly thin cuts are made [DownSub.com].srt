1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
(warm twangy music)

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,700
- This piece of metal is an offcut from a machine shop.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,310
There doesn't seem to be
anything unusual about it

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,710
until I push this piece out.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,120
How amazing is that?

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,770
Until the part is pushed out,

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,743
it's as though there is no seam at all.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,893
Look at this one.

9
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,733
This is called a MetMo cube.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,080
What's cool about this is
there are actually two parts

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,580
that slide in and out,

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,850
and internally they're connected via a small borehole.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,690
So when you push one of them
down, the other one pops up.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,950
It's very satisfying.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,100
But like, how on earth is
one of these things made?

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,890
How can there be almost
no discernible seam

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,570
between these parts?

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,940
Well, these curiosities are made

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,370
with a technique called wire EDM,

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,880
or wire electrical discharge machining.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,120
Wire EDM is used for all
sorts of useful things.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,720
These curiosities aren't useful as such,

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,610
but they're a good way to demonstrate

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,790
the ridiculous precision of wire EDM.

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,460
You may have seen other
examples of this online.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,230
When I did, I became obsessed

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,420
with figuring out how it was made

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,850
and more importantly getting hold of one.

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,560
There are actually a couple
of really clever tricks

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,290
involved in the manufacture
of these invisible seams.

31
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,820
Like when I heard that these were made

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,650
by a process called wire EDM,

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,180
I immediately got distracted

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,970
by what I assumed that must mean.

35
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,970
I just thought, "Oh, right,
it's like a cheese wire."

36
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,650
If you want to cut a circular hole,

37
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,040
then you drag the wire
across into the cheese,

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,400
cut the circle, and then
carefully pull the wire out.

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,620
Or if you don't want this cut here,

40
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,480
you first drill a hole in the cheese,

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,470
we've all done it,

42
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,253
feed the wire through, reattach
it, and then do the cut.

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,300
Another good analogy analogy

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,940
is cutting styrofoam with a hot wire.

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,833
The wire melts the styrofoam.

46
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,220
It's quite therapeutic, actually.

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,330
There's a problem, though.

48
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,150
You either need to have a cut in this part

49
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,030
or a cut and a drill hole in this part,

50
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,360
but neither of these
seem to have those cuts.

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,090
Also, look how much wriggle room there is there.

52
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,650
That's at least half a millimeter.

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,220
Whereas here, there appears
to be no apparent clearance.

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,680
Like, how thin is this flipping wire?

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,930
And actually that's the first trick.

56
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,290
This is actually made from
two separate bits of metal.

57
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,460
First you cut the hole,

58
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,540
then separately you cut the
part that goes into the hole.

59
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,160
And you just have to make sure that you compensate for the thickness of the wire so that when one part slides into the other, it's a nice snug fit.

60
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,070



61
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,740



62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,210


63
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,610
And actually, that's something
we can see with this part

64
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,640
because the piston was
actually cut from over here.

65
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,340
And if I put that piece back
to where it was cut from,

66
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,500
you can see the wriggle room.

67
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,610
Measuring with calipers,

68
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,820
it's about 0.2 millimeters
all the way around.

69
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,710
That's consistent with
the width of the wire.

70
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,470
And look, there's that
unavoidable cut line.

71
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,320
I managed to do the same thing
with the cheese, actually.

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,060
Fits perfectly.

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,410
Now, what about this second trick?

74
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,090
Well, we'll get to that in a moment,

75
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,760
but first how does wire EDM work?

76
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,660
I went to a machine shop

77
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,780
called Travelling Wire in
West Sussex to find out.

78
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,260
So this machine does EDM without a wire,

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,810
and it's a bit easier to see
what's going on, actually.

80
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,070
So this is the part

81
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,310
and this is the tool that's
going to cut into the part,

82
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,770
except it's not cutting
in the normal sense.

83
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,530
The way it works is you
put a really high voltage

84
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,630
between the tool and the part

85
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,830
so that if there were to touch,

86
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,330
it would complete the circuit.

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,670
But in reality, the voltage is so high

88
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,513
that the part and the tool
wouldn't need to touch.

89
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,770
They would only need to get close enough

90
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,170
for a spark to jump from one to the other.

91
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,970
And every time the spark jumps,

92
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,790
it erodes the surface
of the part slightly.

93
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,260
For the purposes of EDM though,

94
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,440
you don't allow the spark
to travel through air.

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,600
Instead you surround the part and the tool

96
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,070
with an insulating liquid.

97
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,260
The liquid has well controlled properties

98
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,650
so it breaks down at predictable
voltages and distances.

99
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,480
It's also a better heat sink than air,

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,750
keeping the bulk of the part
cool to prevent expansion.

101
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,137
Why doesn't an electrical spark

102
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,050
erode a contact point though?

103
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,780
Well, interestingly,
we don't know for sure.

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,450
One impossible explanation is heat.

105
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,120
When there's a spark, a huge
amount of electrical energy

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,070
is converted into heat energy

107
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,720
in a very short period of time,

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,300
so the metal gets very hot, very briefly.

109
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,010
And some of those metal atoms

110
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,230
will vaporize away from the surface.

111
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,660
So if you want to etch away at something,

112
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,040
this is the tool for you.

113
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,845
But if you want to
slice through something,

114
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:38,610
you need a different tool.

115
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,770
That's where wire EDM comes in.

116
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,445
This is one of Travelling
Wire's wire EDM machines.

117
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:46,020
By the way, check out the
link to Travelling Wire

118
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,200
in the description for
all your wire EDM needs.

119
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,490
They're not paying me to say that.

120
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,540
So we want to cut out

121
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,760
a little bit of this sheet of metal here.

122
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,200
There's already a hole in the middle

123
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,270
so we can feed the wire through there.

124
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,090
This jet of water helps to guide the wire

125
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,470
as it's being fed in,

126
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,520
and once it's through the hole,

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,740
some machinery underneath grabs it.

128
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,960
The whole thing is then submerged in water.

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
Actually, water is only
a good insulating liquid

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,830
if it's free of ions,

131
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,230
so this water is deionized.

132
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,370
There's a machine around the back

133
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,460
that takes tap water
and this special resin.

134
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,310
It does something with it and
pumps out deionized water.

135
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,590
Unfortunately, once the
sides of the tank are up

136
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,760
and the thing's filled with water,

137
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,230
you really can't see what's going on.

138
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,460
Not that it matters

139
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,470
when you've got a
brilliant cheese analogy.

140
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,620
One big difference between the
cheese wire and the EDM wire

141
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,200
is that the EDM wire is constantly moving.

142
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,150
These pulleys are constantly turning, and if we go around the back you can see it's being chopped up and spat out.

143
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,100


144
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,650


145
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,690
That's because the wire itself erodes

146
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,670
as well as the part you're machining.

147
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,720
This spool here contains about
10 kilometers of brass wire.

148
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,970
And look, there's the part now,

149
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,160
cut out exactly how Richard here

150
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,050
drew it in his CAD software.

151
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,840
You can also angle the wire in clever ways

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,370
so you can cut tapered parts

153
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,680
and holes that have a
different shape at the opening

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,880
than they do at the end.

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,190
You can do all sorts of
cool stuff with wire EDM.

156
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,140
But what about that second trick?

157
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,570
Well, look, here's the
first part that I showed you

158
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,090
when it's halfway through
the manufacturing process.

159
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,180
The piston is already cut
out and it fits perfectly.

160
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,680
But look, because it was cut

161
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,570
from a different part of the metal,

162
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,250
you can see it, right?

163
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,770
You can see that it's a
different piece of metal.

164
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,400
So the final trick is to
polish, or grind, really,

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
the two parts together in situ.

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,930
By grinding the two parts
together in this way,

167
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,240
they obtain a matching finish.

168
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,750
The grain of the abrasion
pattern flows seamlessly

169
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,780
across the seam.

170
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,170
And so it seems as though
the seam can't be seen.

171
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,690
And look, you can achieve
the same thing with cheese.

172
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,550
Even knowing how this is done,

173
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,070
the precision is unbelievable.

174
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,200
A typical wire EDM machine
will have a precision

175
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,150
of around 5000ths of a millimeter,

176
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,510
which in inches is a different number.

177
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,180
Why is wire EDM so precise?

178
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,690
Well, it's mainly because the tool and the part never touch so they don't perturb each other in the same way that you get with an abrading tool.

179
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,790


180
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,010


181
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,890
So there you go, wire EDM.

182
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,010
The mechanism that joins
this thing to this thing

183
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,100
is really clever but not in
the way that you might think,

184
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,840
and actually not in a good way.

185
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
In fact, it's in an evil way.

186
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Let me explain.

187
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,050
The mechanism is just complicated enough

188
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,810
and just novel enough to be patentable.

189
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,490
That means no other manufacturer

190
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,460
is allowed to make blade cartridges

191
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,900
that go with this handle,

192
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,410
which means if you buy this
handle you can only buy blades

193
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,090
from the same manufacturer

194
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,580
at a significantly inflated price.

195
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,980
The same thing is true for
single use coffee pods.

196
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,813
The same thing is true

197
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:46,920
for the heads of electric toothbrushes.

198
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,310
And amazingly, the same thing
is true for the uranium rods

199
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,250
that go into certain nuclear power plants.

200
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,510
Like, wouldn't it be nice

201
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,420
if you could just pay a reasonable price

202
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,740
for your nuclear power plant?

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,330
And then you get to buy the uranium rods

204
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,410
from wherever you like.

205
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,340
Wait, sorry.

206
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,870
I mean, wouldn't it be nice

207
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,805
if you could pay a reasonable price

208
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:09,330
for a really well-engineered
razor blade handle,

209
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,150
and then you get to buy the
blades from wherever you like?

210
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,983
And actually,

211
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:16,230
even the really good quality
ones are just pennies.

212
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,570
And that's the idea behind Henson Shaving,

213
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,890
the sponsor of this video.

214
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,900
The Henson AL13 is what you get

215
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,150
when a family-run aerospace machine shop

216
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,010
pivots to making its own products.

217
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,680
Its CNC machines to aerospace standards,

218
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,421
and because it's all metal,
the blades are well supported,

219
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:34,140
unlike the multi-blade
plastic cartridge razors.

220
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,789
And it's just nice to own something

221
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,519
that's well made that you're
gonna make good use of,

222
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,470
nevermind the fact that
the total cost of ownership

223
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,799
would easily be cartridge
razors after only a few months.

224
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,000
But what's it like to use?

225
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,050
Well, I shaved this side of
my face with the Henson AL13

226
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,700
and I shaved this side of my face

227
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,920
with the leading cartridge brand,

228
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,080
and the difference is remarkable.

229
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,630
