1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
- When I tug the end of this
thread, a short distance,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,500
the spool zips towards me,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,060
and because it's on a slight incline.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,860
When I let go, it rolls away again.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,600
So just with the slightest movement,

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,330
I can cause the spool
to zip back and forth.

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,320
How weird is that?

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,450
I stumbled upon this after
watching a six year old

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,970
Physics Girl video, link in
the description for that.

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,980
In the video, Diana poses the question,

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,470
what will happen when I pull on this cord?

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,020
Will the spool roll away
from me or towards me?

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,130
Actually, I think the question

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,260
with the more counterintuitive answer is

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,600
will the cord get longer or shorter?

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,690
Because you know, if you tog on a cord that's wrapped around a spool, you expect the cord to unspool a bit so that you have more cord.

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,290


18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,030


19
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,710
But based on the shot that I showed you

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,780
at the very beginning, you
may already have figured

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,130
out that the spool will roll

22
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,470
towards you and the cord will get shorter.

23
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,690
The reason I started playing
around with it for myself is

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,840
because I wanted to answer
two follow on questions.

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,210
The first one, what happens in the limit

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,970
like you've got this distance
here, which is a measure

27
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,030
of how much room there
is left in the spool.

28
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,580
What happens as that
distance approaches zero?

29
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,140
As the spool gets full?

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,410
As a teaser, you end up with
infinite mechanical advantage.

31
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,080
And secondly, I wanted to
know what happens if you go

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,310
beyond that point, if you go
past the spool being full,

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,310
if the loose end of the
cord is below the ground.

34
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,240
But before we get into that,

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,940
let's see if we can explain
the counterintuitive answer

36
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,140
to the original question.

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,250
So when you pull on the rope

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,430
it gets shorter as the
spool rolls towards you

39
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,110
and there are actually two ways

40
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,760
of looking at why that happens.

41
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,430
The first way which is less
intuitive I would argue

42
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,770
is just to think about forces.

43
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,160
So forgetting all the detail,
you've got some object

44
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,810
it has a pivot point here

45
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,750
and you are pulling it
with a force from here.

46
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,430
So of course the object is going to move

47
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,970
around that pivot point in the
same direction as the force.

48
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,130
But then of course the pivot point moves

49
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,350
and so you have a rolling motion.

50
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,460
The other way to think about it

51
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,050
which is a bit more intuitive for me

52
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,550
is to think about what happens

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,060
to the rope when you roll
the spool away from you.

54
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,650
Let's roll it a quarter turn.

55
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,200
So this is the distance
the spool has traveled

56
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,900
and it's equal to a quarter
of the circumference.

57
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,470
Now, in doing so, we have unspooled some of the rope.

58
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,940
How much rope have we unspooled?

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, just this amount here

60
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,310
which is less than the distance
the spool has traveled.

61
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,410
In other words, we
haven't unspooled enough

62
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,850
of the rope to compensate

63
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,710
for the distance the spool has traveled.

64
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,800
The result is that the rope
is pulled from our hands.

65
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,270
The rope is pulled away from us.

66
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,250
That means if we do the opposite

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,350
and pull the rope towards us,

68
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,450
the spool should do the opposite as well

69
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,860
and roll towards us.

70
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,510
By the way, I'm assuming
that there is always

71
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,730
enough friction between
the spool and the table

72
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,340
so the spool always rolls
instead of slipping.

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,260
Interestingly, if I pull the rope upwards

74
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,760
then the opposite happens.

75
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,880
The rope gets longer as the
spool rolls away from me.

76
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,770
That means there must
be a point somewhere in

77
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,200
between vertical and
horizontal where the spool

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,320
neither rolls away, nor rolls
towards the pulling force.

79
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,510
Interestingly, the angle
of the rope doesn't just

80
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,030
affect the angle that
the force is applied.

81
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,340
It also affects the point on the object.

82
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,170
The force is applied to

83
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,120
like when I'm pulling vertically upwards

84
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,100
the force is being applied from here.

85
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,510
But when I'm pulling horizontally,

86
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,310
the force is being applied down here.

87
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,410
Look, as I change the angle of the rope,

88
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,210
there comes a point where the direction

89
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,340
of the force passes
through the pivot point.

90
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,650
And if the force is passing
through the pivot point,

91
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,110
then it can't be applying a turning force

92
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,520
around that pivot point.

93
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,470
So that's the magic angle.

94
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,730
I won't go through the mathematics

95
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,260
but here it is on the screen.

96
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,300
That's the angle at which the spool will

97
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,760
neither roll towards or away

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,220
and then it's impossible
to have enough friction.

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,990
The spool simply slides.

100
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,690
But what happens in the
limit as the spool fills

101
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,910
up with rope, when you've
got only a tiny gap

102
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,070
between the rope and
the edge of the spool,

103
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,130
like the spool is almost full,
you really do need to worry

104
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,800
about if there's enough
friction to avoid slipping.

105
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,620
So I'm using this high friction mat here

106
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,960
and I've switched to a less stretchy rope.

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,870
And just like with the sewing
thread for a really short tug

108
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,720
on the rope, the spool
travels a really long way.

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,240
I have some serious mechanical
advantage here, and actually

110
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,820
it's really easy to calculate
the mechanical advantage.

111
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,770
It's just the distance traveled

112
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,310
by the force divided by the
distance traveled by the load.

113
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,180
In this case, it's this distance
divided by this distance

114
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,760
which works out to be this
length divided by this length

115
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,280
which works out to be this radius divided

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,040
by itself minus this radius.

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,660
So if this radius is one

118
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,630
and this radius is very
nearly one like 0.9,

119
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,760
then you have a mechanical
advantage of 10.

120
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,180
Actually, it's the spool that
has the mechanical advantage

121
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,920
over me, right?

122
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Because the spool has a low
force over a large distance.

123
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,543
Yeah, that's right.

124
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:47,220
My hand has a mechanical disadvantage

125
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,040
but it means I can get something
to move a long distance

126
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,920
by applying a large force
over a short distance.

127
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,710
And brilliantly, when you
fill the spool up completely

128
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,090
you get a singularity

129
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,400
in the equation for mechanical advantage.

130
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,140
Not a singularity in that sense

131
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,490
but a singularity in the sense

132
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,390
of like in this simplified
mathematical description

133
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,920
we get an infinity.

134
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,900
We have infinite mechanical advantage.

135
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,300
Obviously, you can't get
that in the real world.

136
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,620
Something has to fail

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,780
and the first thing to fail is friction.

138
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,330
In this case, we just end
up dragging the thing along.

139
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,430
But also when the spool is nearly full,

140
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,890
you hardly have to tilt the rope up at all

141
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,100
for the solution to flip
and the spool to roll away.

142
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,260
And it explains our
experience with toilet roll.

143
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,230
The spool of toilet roll is
by definition always full.

144
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,030
It's always being pulled from the edge

145
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,800
of the spool because the loose end

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,810
of the toilet roll is
the edge of the spool.

147
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,140
So what happens if you carry
on past the spool being full?

148
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,973
Well, in reality,

149
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,230
the rope itself would
become the outermost part

150
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,840
of the spool and you'd have
the toilet roll situation.

151
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,730
But what if you could
somehow keep the frame

152
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,383
of the spool on the ground so

153
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,830
that the rope was being
pulled from under the ground?

154
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,750
Basically, I just wanna see what happens

155
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,040
to the maths as this radius
gets bigger than this radius

156
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,590
without having to worry
about real world constraints

157
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,290
like the fact that rope
can't pass through a table.

158
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,270
Well, I can achieve that with this setup.

159
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,400
So this is now the radius of the spool.

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,440
The radius of the rope is greater

161
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,720
than the radius of the spool,
which is what we wanted

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,640
and it's able to pass through the table.

163
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,740
This clear acrylic is
now just there to hold

164
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,573
the rope in place.

165
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,230
It's not part of the spool geometry.

166
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,150
So will the spool roll towards me

167
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,430
or away from me when I pull on the rope?

168
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,080
Remember the two ways
of thinking about it.

169
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,147
You can consider this
to be the pivot point

170
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:28,667
and the force is being applied here.

171
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,210
Or you can think about what will happen

172
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,880
to the rope if I roll the
spool one way or the other.

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,650
So this time the spool rolls away

174
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,500
from me when I pull on the
rope and the rope gets longer.

175
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,040
Again, that makes sense from
a pivot point, point of view.

176
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,140
And if you think about what
happens when the spool rolls

177
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,990
towards you, well, this is
how far the spool travels

178
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,470
and this is how much rope you
are adding back to the spool.

179
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,360
In other words, the
rope is being taken away

180
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,330
from you more quickly than the
spool is coming towards you.

181
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,640
And again, the rope is
pulled away from your hands.

182
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,400
So if you do the opposite and
pull the rope towards you,

183
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,130
you should expect the spool
to do the opposite as well.

184
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,290
It's interesting to
note that in this setup,

185
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,810
the spool will always roll
to the right regardless

186
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,450
of the angle I choose,
whereas with this setup

187
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,730
there's an angle at which it flips.

188
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,770
And that makes sense
because in this setup,

189
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,590
the force vector never passes
through the pivot point.

190
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,050
There are two other limits to consider.

191
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,070
There's the limit as the spool
tends towards being empty.

192
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,030
And if we assume that there is
no central hole in the spool

193
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,550
then it's just being pulled
from the very center.

194
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,370
And if we assume that the
cord has no thickness,

195
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,680
then the infinitely thin central axis

196
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
of the spool will gather no cord.

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,820
In that scenario, the spool would travel

198
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,180
at exactly the same speed as
the hand pulling on the cord.

199
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,760
But what about taking
this setup to the extreme?

200
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,530
Just keep adding rope.

201
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,140
What happens in the
limit of infinite rope?

202
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,850
Well, that's a slightly
tricky thing to build

203
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,310
but what we're really saying
is what happens in the limit

204
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,810
as this radius becomes infinitely
larger than this radius

205
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,920
and we can achieve that

206
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,330
by seeing what happens as this
radius tends towards zero.

207
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,060
I 3D printed this
modification to give us a very

208
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,060
small spool radius, and what we notice is

209
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,970
that the spool hardly moves
at all, and that makes sense.

210
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,180
Every rotation of the spool
gives us loads of rope

211
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,763
but causes hardly any travel of the spool.

212
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,990
I really appreciate a
straightforward product pitch.

213
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,330
Like, here's a thing you
probably want to get done

214
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,550
but it'll take you ages to
figure out how to do it.

215
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,840
We've already figured it out.

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,280
We're super efficient at it.

217
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,930
Would you like us to do it for you?

218
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,059
And the sponsor of this video, Incogni,

219
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,129
fits that description perfectly.

220
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,480
So here's what Incogni offers.

221
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,820
There are these companies
called data brokers

222
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,740
that collect data about us

223
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,320
and then sell that data
to other companies.

224
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,810
We don't know who they're selling to

225
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,340
but we can contact them

226
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,980
and ask them to stop and delete our data.

227
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,840
The problem is there
are literally hundreds

228
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,630
of them and they all want to
be contacted in different ways.

229
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,410
Some want you to email, some
want you to fill in a web form,

230
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,300
some of them will reject your request

231
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,130
and you have to figure out how to appeal.

232
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,450
Incogni have figured out all

233
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,850
of that stuff already
and they've automated it.

234
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,890
So now you can sign up to Incogni,

235
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,960
give them the right to
work on your behalf,

236
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,670
and they just get to it

237
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,860
and you can see the
progress on the dashboard.

238
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,930
Look, these are all the
companies that now no

239
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,700
longer have my data, and honestly

240
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,170
one thing I really like
is that they're not

241
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,050
constantly banging on about
what they're doing for you.

242
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,000
They'll send you a
progress email once a week

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,330
if you want them to, or you can
just check on the dashboard.

244
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,280
What I've noticed now is
that I don't get any more

245
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,280
of those weird phone calls from
companies that I don't know

246
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,650
but that seem to know a lot about me.

247
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,440
And it's just one of those
things that I wanted to get done.

248
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,060
And now it's done.

249
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,250
If you're interested, the offer
on this one is really good.
