1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,640
- This is a camera that can see sound.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,970
In other words, it can show
you where in a scene sounds

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,803
are coming from.

4
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,370
How acoustic cameras work,

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,980
and what they're capable of is remarkable.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,640
But before we get into that,
I went to an anechoic chamber

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,320
to have a play with one.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,890
Here's me playing the ukulele
and talking at the same time.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,230
It's interesting that the
sound appears to switch

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,440
between coming from my mouth
and coming from the ukulele,

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,930
even though sometimes
both are making a sound

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,950
at the same time.

13
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,380
And brilliantly, this
is completely analogous

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,140
to a traditional light-based camera.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,500
What we have here is an
issue of dynamic range.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,770
If you have your camera
set to automatic exposure

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,990
which your smartphone is by default,

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,630
and you shoot a video of a dim light,

19
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,290
then turn on a much brighter
light, the camera will switch

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,440
between showing you lots
of detail of the dim light

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,530
to showing you lots of
detail of the bright light.

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,650
And the same thing is happening
here with the ukulele.

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,440
The ukulele is louder than my voice.

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,180
So when the ukulele is being played,

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,750
the acoustic camera dials
down its sensitivity

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,870
and you can no longer see my voice.

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,390
But when I stop strumming the ukulele, the camera dials up the sensitivity, and then you can see my voice.


28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,300


29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,150
What's really cool is
that because my voice is

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,730
in a different frequency
range to the ukulele,

31
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,370
it's possible to isolate just my voice

32
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,040
and ignore the ukulele or vice versa.

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,810
And actually, this starts to hint

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,710
at one of the industrial
applications for acoustic cameras.

35
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,768
One really noisy appliance
is a vacuum cleaner.

36
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,990
(vacuum cleaner buzzing)

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,420
It just seems like a cacophony of sound.

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,190
But look at this spectrogram,

39
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,460
which is like a heat map of
the different frequencies

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,260
that the vacuum cleaner is producing.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,910
You can see that there are a handful

42
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,190
of really strong frequencies.

43
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,450
With the acoustic camera software,

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,670
you can isolate different frequencies.

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,060
So look, this frequency
here we now can see

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,670
is from the tube of the vacuum cleaner.

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,130
So we now know that the tube
of the vacuum cleaner resonates

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,100
at 400 hertz, and we
can see that the motor

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,210
of the vacuum cleaner produces
a frequency of 7,000 hertz.

50
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,830
And all this is really useful information

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,800
if you're trying to engineer
a quieter appliance.

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,380
Another cool trick is once you have the recording, you can use something akin to the eyedropper tool in Photoshop to point at different parts of the recording and see what just that part sounds like.

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,170


54
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,290


55
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,350


56
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,183
How cool is that?

57
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,620
Thanks by the way, to
Ian McFarlane from AcSoft

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,230
who supply acoustic cameras in the U.K.

59
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,430
Check them out in the description

60
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,110
for all your acoustic camera needs.

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,610
They're not paying me
to say that, by the way.

62
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,770
And thanks also to Manny and Zomi

63
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,830
and the Birmingham Center for
Railway Research Education

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,770
at the University of Birmingham
who hosted the whole thing.

65
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,290
Why would a railway research
facility be interested

66
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,910
in using an acoustic camera?

67
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,230
Well, here's one setup, track
side and as trains go by,

68
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,680
you can identify what
wheels are making a noise

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,030
and need maintenance.

70
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,484
Without this kind of monitoring,
often the first you know

71
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:04,530
about a problem with a
train is when it breaks down

72
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,980
in service which causes
delays and costs money.

73
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,200
Like imagine the lost productivity

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,480
if all these people were late for work.

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,610
I actually realized
I've got this hypothesis

76
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,850
that I could test using
the acoustic cameras.

77
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,500
There's this demo that I used to do for live shows like, you know, science shows for kids where you get an aluminum rod like this and you pinch it in the middle

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,840



79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,940


80
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,520


81
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,097
and then with a bit of
rosin between your fingers

82
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:34,620
you pinch along the rod
and headphone warning,

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,388
it makes a horribly high-pitched sound.

84
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:40,055
(rod screaming)

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,630
It's horrible, isn't it?

86
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,030
The question is, how is the rod vibrating?

87
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,760
Is it vibrating in the same way that like when you twang a ruler waggling like that?


88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,330


89
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,050
Or is it more like, you know when you pluck a guitar string?

90
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,810
So it's kind of like, you
know it's going like that.

91
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,730
Well, depending on how it's vibrating,

92
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,970
the sound would be coming from
different parts of the rod.

93
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,220
And you can see here
that the sound is coming

94
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,640
from the very tips of the
rod, and that's consistent

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,280
with a really unexpected vibrational mode

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
where the rod is essentially contracting

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,079
and then expanding and
contracting and expanding.

98
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,839
One thing that's insanely
cool about acoustic cameras

99
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,100
is the frame rate.

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,020
Like a typical frame rate for a camera

101
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,820
is 60 frames per second.

102
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,220
That's what I film my YouTube videos in.

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,340
But when you record sound,
you are typically sampling

104
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,850
at about 40,000 samples per second.

105
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,370
And when you translate
that to an acoustic camera,

106
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,640
that's 40,000 frames per second.

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,110
So by accident, acoustic cameras
are also high-speed cameras

108
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,120
which means you can do things like film

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,580
what an echo looks like
and then play it back

110
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,110
in super-slow motion.

111
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,400
Before we get to that though,

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,280
I want to explain how
acoustic cameras work.

113
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,500
And actually this relates to
a video I made a while back

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,560
about how humans detect
where sounds are coming from,

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,030
linked to that in the
card in the description,

116
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,030
but here's a quick summary
of the salient part.

117
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,830
We detect where sounds
are coming from based

118
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,980
on the timings of sound
reaching our two ears.

119
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,110
So if a sound is coming
from directly in front,

120
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,970
it'll reach both ears at the same time.

121
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,520
And that's how we know
it's coming from in front.

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,700
But suppose there's a
delay of 0.3 milliseconds,

123
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,770
that tells our brain the sound is coming

124
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,680
from like off to one
side, like over there.

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,790
But actually it could also be coming

126
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,810
from over there, couldn't it?

127
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,950
Cuz the delay would be the same,

128
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,680
or like up there at an
angle, or down there.

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,200
In fact, there's a whole
region of possible places

130
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,580
the sound could be coming from.

131
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,550
And that region is called
the cone of confusion,

132
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,210
though technically it's a
hyperboloid of confusion.

133
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,530
Here's an illustration of that.

134
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,450
The two yellow dots are the ears

135
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,810
and here is the cone of
possible locations of a sound

136
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,900
for which the delay between
the two ears is the same.

137
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,060
So how do you reduce that surface

138
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,120
of possible sound locations
down to a single point?

139
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,330
Well, the human brain has lots
of clever ways of doing that.

140
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,340
But for a device like an acoustic camera,

141
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,680
you just need to add more ears.

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,310
Like here, look, imagine
if I added a third ear.

143
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,760
Well, the same sound source
will create a new cone

144
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,060
based on the delay
between this pair of ears.

145
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,220
So now we know that the
sound must be coming

146
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,760
from a point that rests
on both of these cones.

147
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,940
In other words, somewhere
along this intersecting line.

148
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,670
You might be thinking, well
there's another pairing of ears

149
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,720
we haven't looked at.

150
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,970
These two ears make another cone.

151
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,890
But actually the way the maths works out

152
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,010
all three cones intersect
at the same hyperbole.

153
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,980
So to really pinpoint
the location of a sound,

154
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,330
you need a fourth ear.

155
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,720
A fourth ear would give us three new ear pairings and therefore three new cones of confusion.

156
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,020


157
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,120
But if I showed all three new cones,

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,490
that would be confusing.

159
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,500
But just by adding one of them, we can see

160
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,280
that it passes through the
hyperbole in just one place.

161
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,510
So with four ears,

162
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,570
you should be able to
locate the exact direction

163
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,850
and distance to the sound source.

164
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,120
So why do these acoustic cameras
need more than four ears?

165
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,810
Well, what if there were two
sound sources simultaneously?

166
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,860
In that scenario,

167
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,120
two microphones would receive
completely different sounds.

168
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,595
That's because the sounds
from the two sources

169
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,500
would overlap differently

170
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,336
because of the different travel times

171
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,820
to the two different microphones.

172
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,220
That's okay for humans
because humans are good

173
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,000
at filtering sounds in
all sorts of clever ways.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,250
But for software, that's a problem.

175
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,610
So instead, what the
software does is analyze

176
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,120
individual frequencies
instead of the whole waveform.

177
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,460
So where a human brain
is trying to match up

178
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,660
complex wave forms, the
acoustic camera is looking at

179
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,521
individual frequencies and
the difference in phase

180
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,370
at the two microphones.

181
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,660
And it turns out that when you're looking

182
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,730
at different frequencies individually,

183
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,510
the distance between mics
becomes really important.

184
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,860
For any given frequency,

185
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,110
there's an optimum distance between mics.

186
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,260
So by having lots of
mics, you can have a range

187
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,900
of different distances between mics,

188
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,340
and so you'll be able to analyze

189
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,830
more frequencies more accurately.

190
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,020
In my previous video
that I mentioned earlier,

191
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,220
I talk about why a high
frequency sound is problematic

192
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,650
for microphones that are far apart

193
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,430
and actually it's problematic
for human ears as well.

194
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,630
So I won't repeat myself,

195
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,310
but the link is in the description.

196
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,390
But anyway, all this explains
why this acoustic camera also

197
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,559
from gfai tech has mics
that are irregularly spaced.

198
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,389
If the mics replaced at regular intervals,

199
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,880
you would have some repeating distances

200
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,049
between pairs of mics.

201
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,939
Like all these distances are the same,

202
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,409
all these distances are the same.

203
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,300
By having a irregularly spaced mics,

204
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,690
you cover a greater range
of distances between mics.

205
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,000
How acoustic cameras
work is more complicated

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,470
than I've presented here.

207
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,400
Like for example,

208
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,007
having more mics gives you
essentially better resolution,

209
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,850
but it's beyond the scope of this video.

210
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,260
I kind of glossed over the fact

211
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,860
that you get depth information
from an array of microphones.

212
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,630
So here's a more recent model

213
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,630
from gfai tech that
takes advantage of that.

214
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,550
The video camera in the middle of this one

215
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,020
captures depth information.

216
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,820
So when you're traveling around an object,

217
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,380
you're basically scanning it.

218
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,800
You can then map the
sound onto that 3D object

219
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
and look around it.

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,833
How cool is that?

221
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:22,800
But the coolest thing for me

222
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,040
was watching an echo
propagate around the room.

223
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,090
This is Paul.

224
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,730
After the initial clap,
which is obviously centered

225
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,900
on his hands, you start to see
these other hotspots flashing

226
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,070
around the screen where the
sound is bouncing off walls.

227
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,020
The echo itself takes milliseconds,

228
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,380
but you can see all this
detail in slow motion.

229
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,700
So flipping cool.

230
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,860
The echo pattern looks quite
a bit different when you are

231
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,813
in the corner of a room.

232
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,360
I'm really interested in the logic

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,420
behind different business
models like food delivery apps

234
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,730
for example, I'm hungry,
I don't wanna cook

235
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,070
I don't wanna go out, and
I want lots of choice,

236
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,120
food delivery apps.

237
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,190
The logic is incredibly straightforward

238
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,080
and so is the logic behind the sponsor

239
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,640
of this video, Incogni.

240
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,800
They offer something that you want,

241
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,840
but you don't want to do yourself

242
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,130
but it's not food delivery.

243
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,540
Why am I hungry now.?

244
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,923
Here's what Incogni offers.

245
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,460
There are these companies
called data brokers

246
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,900
that collect data about you

247
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,370
and then shout it onto other people.

248
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,770
You don't know who they're selling it to,

249
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,540
but you can contact them and say,

250
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,210
stop doing that and also delete my data.

251
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,160
The problem is there are
thousands of these companies

252
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,350
and they all want to be
contacted in different ways

253
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,270
and sometimes they'll reject your requests

254
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,250
and you have to appeal and
all this sort of stuff.

255
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,530
It will take months to do it yourself.

256
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,760
And actually it took Incogni
months to do it the first time

257
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,350
but now they've automated it all.

258
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,020
One company has done all the hard work

259
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,090
and now we can all benefit from it.

260
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,820
So now I can just sign up to Incogni,

261
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,860
give them permission to act on my behalf,

262
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,780
and they just take care of it.

263
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,580
I've been within Incogni
for a little while

264
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,680
so I can show you the progress.

265
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,900
Look, these are all the
companies that have confirmed

266
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,330
that they now don't have my data.

267
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,210
It's a really unobtrusive
service, which I value.

268
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,530
It just happens in the background.

269
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,720
But it's funny, like it's so unobtrusive

270
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,843
that I was saying to my wife
the other day, you know what?

271
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:14,610
I don't get any of those
weird phone calls anymore

272
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,380
from companies that don't recognize

273
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,510
who seem to know a lot about me.

274
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,750
Maybe the U.K. have changed legislation

275
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,430
so that companies can't do that.

276
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,236
Oh, no, wait, hold on.

277
00:11:25,236 --> 00:11:27,840
It's Incogni, isn't it?

278
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,540
Like I just hadn't put,
you know, it's I, I forgot.

279
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,373
And that's it.

280
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:32,460
You know, it's peace of mind.

281
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,293
You just do it.

282
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,417
And then that thing that
you were supposed to do,

283
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,630
you've done it.

284
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,550
The promo on this one
is three times better

285
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,930
