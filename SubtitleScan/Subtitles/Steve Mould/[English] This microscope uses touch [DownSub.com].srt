1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,220
- This is a polo mint,
the British equivalent

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,019
of a Life Saver under a microscope,

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,330
except it's a really weird microscope.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,260
Honestly, I'm not sure

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,270
that you could even call it a microscope.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,880
I just don't know how to
characterize this thing.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,533
Look, here's a Lego brick,

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,500
and what about this thing?

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,580
What is this?

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,413
I'll tell you at the end

11
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:20,340
of the video if you want to
have a guess in the meantime.

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,410
What's weird about these images is

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,970
that there's no color information

14
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,980
or transparency information.

15
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,170
What we're seeing is just the shape.

16
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,820
In that way it's kind of reminiscent

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,189
of what you see under an electron microscope,

18
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,770
but actually this is a
normal sized Lego brick

19
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,590
and this microscope uses touch

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,910
and I got to play with one thanks

21
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,560
to the Sempre Group who
said I could come round

22
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,393
and have a play.

23
00:00:41,393 --> 00:00:43,740
They're are distributor of
precision measurement instruments

24
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,780
in the UK, link to what
they do in the description.

25
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,040
They're not paying me to make this video

26
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,050
neither is the manufacturer of the device.

27
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,990
I just saw it out the corner
of my eye when I was walking

28
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,060
around the advanced engineering expo

29
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,780
and I went up to them and said,
can I make a YouTube video?

30
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,370
So thank you for saying yes.

31
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,050
It's a handheld device.

32
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,850
It's called Gel Site because

33
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,340
at the end there's this gel pad.

34
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,620
The gel is especially formulated so

35
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,180
that when you push an object into it the gel deforms so that it can get into all the tiny nooks and crannies of the object.

36
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,250


37
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,280


38
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,130
Just behind the gel, there's
a camera pointing at it

39
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,490
and crucially, there is
a ring of six lights.

40
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,590
What you see in the preview image

41
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,290
on the screen is just
what the camera sees when

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,140
only one of those lights is switched on.

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,050
And you can see how the
image changes as we cycle

44
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,340
through the six lights.

45
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,370
By illuminating the
deformed gel in this way,

46
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,370
the human visual system
can discern the shape

47
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,700
of the object using cues
about light and shade

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,620
and shadows and highlights.

49
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,010
It's a bit like whitewashing
the object because by doing so

50
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,330
you are removing all information

51
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,370
about color and transparency.

52
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,720
And you might think, well

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,830
what's the point of a microscope
that removes information?

54
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,950
Why don't we just stick with
a light-based microscope

55
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,200
and then we don't lose any information?

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,750
Well, it turns out that
with some clever mathematics

57
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,660
we can actually gain
information that we would never

58
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,330
have had access to with
a regular microscope.

59
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,163
And it's all to do

60
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,800
with those six lights
arranged around the gel pad,

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,160
like in the preview image where
only one light is turned on.

62
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,530
The human eye can
discern things like, well

63
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,770
this area is higher up than this area.

64
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,750
This area slopes down to the left.

65
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,330
This area slopes down
to the right and so on.

66
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,970
But could a computer
brain do the same thing?

67
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,120
Well, it turns out that

68
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,050
if you present the computer
brain with six images,

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,410
one taken with each of the
six different light sources

70
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,130
you can use a clever algorithm
to analyze those six images

71
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,990
and come up with a 3D model

72
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,500
of that object accurate to
plus or minus four microns

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,210
in the case of this device

74
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,210
which is way better than
the human brain can do.

75
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,520
It's called the photometric
stereo technique

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,000
and there are publicly
available papers on the subject

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,490
and then there's some
proprietary stuff on top

78
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,070
in the case of this
device, and you can see why

79
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,400
it would be desirable
to remove information

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,700
about color and
transparency from the object

81
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,000
before trying to run the
algorithm on the six images.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,620
By removing all color information

83
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,900
we can say with certainty that this region

84
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,980
of the image is bright because
it's facing the light source.

85
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,310
This region of the image is
dark because it's facing away

86
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,340
from the light source, but
real life objects have light

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,880
and dark regions unrelated
to the lighting of the thing.

88
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,790
In principle, the algorithm
should be able to cope

89
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,340
with objects that have
light and dark regions

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,380
because after all, it's only looking

91
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,140
at the differences that it perceives

92
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,620
from the six different images
at each point on the object

93
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,630
unless part of the object is jet black

94
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,940
in which case it's jet black regardless

95
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,860
of what direction it's lit from.

96
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,810
But perhaps the most challenging thing for the algorithm is transparency, reflection, and glare

97
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,810


98
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,060
and the gel pad removes
all of those things.

99
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,830
I think there's an
interesting distinction here

100
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,710
between human brains and computer brains.

101
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,440
Like human brains can
discern 3D information

102
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,500
from flat images of things,
even when color, glare,

103
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,050
and transparency haven't
been removed from the object.

104
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,960
That's because the human
brain can draw on experience.

105
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,899
Like your brain recognizes this flat image

106
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,590
of a Lego minifigure head
as a Lego minifigure head,

107
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,590
your brain doesn't think,
oh this region is dark

108
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,230
because it's facing away
from the light source.

109
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,200
You know that it's the eyeball.

110
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,260
Perhaps one day with the
addition of machine learning

111
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,210
an algorithm like the one used

112
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,540
by Gel Site could discern 3D information

113
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,030
from objects that haven't had color glare

114
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,220
transparency and reflection removed

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,120
by training the neural
network on everyday objects

116
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,820
in the same way that our
brains have been trained

117
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,790
through our lives to recognize objects.

118
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,650
There's an interesting side note here

119
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,800
about the way human brains perceive depth.

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
Like the human brain perceives depth

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
in lots of different ways.

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,580
For example, by having two
eyeballs, the slight difference

123
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,790
in the two images that
each eyeball gets can be

124
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,400
used to extract information about depth.

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Another example is parallax.

126
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,240
There's loads of different
ways we perceive depth

127
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,250
but one way that's relevant

128
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,910
to this video is using light cues.

129
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,850
We don't need to take six different images

130
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,750
of an object with a light source
in six different locations.

131
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,150
We can do it with just
a single light source.

132
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,820
But to do that, your brain
has to make an assumption

133
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,890
and every time your
brain makes an assumption

134
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,000
it can be tricked.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,520
It can be tricked with
an optical illusion.

136
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,140
Take this image, for example.

137
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,930
It looks like a mountain of some kind

138
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,370
but if I turn it 180 degrees,
you can now see it's a crater.

139
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,140
It's called the crater illusion.

140
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,600
Your brain is tricked in this orientation

141
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,490
because it assumes the scene is lit

142
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,490
from the top down, and
that's a sensible assumption

143
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,230
given our every day experience.

144
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,690
Light typically comes from above us.

145
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,790
And the cool thing is you
can see the crater illusion

146
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,720
with these images.

147
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,690
Like here, the lettering
looks like it's sticking out

148
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,540
but that's only because
it's being lit from below.

149
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,700
By switching to the light at the top

150
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,760
you can see that the
lettering is in fact indented.

151
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,100
And of course, the crater
illusion disappears.

152
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,410
Where there are other
depth clues available

153
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,830
like no one would see this face as concave

154
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,590
even though it's lit from
below, because our experience

155
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,790
of faces gives us overriding
information about depth.

156
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,070
So what's this device actually used for?

157
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,020
Well, using the software
that comes with it

158
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,850
you can take actual measurements.

159
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,620
So you can see that the lettering

160
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,040
on this coin is raised by 70 microns

161
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,080
and this is really what
the device is all about.

162
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,100
It's handheld.

163
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,450
You can take it around with you

164
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,290
press it into things, and
as a manufacturer, let's say

165
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,360
you can figure out the tolerances

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,730
of the things you are
making in your factory.

167
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,270
You can also characterize a
surface and say how rough it is.

168
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,610
Another scenario is an
aircraft has a scratch

169
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,443
on the surface

170
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,370
and you need to characterize
the scratch to figure

171
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,350
out whether the aircraft can still fly.

172
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,850
Traditionally, you would create a cast

173
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,850
of the scratch and then
measure the cast in a lab, but

174
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,250
with this handheld device, you
can do it in a few minutes.

175
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,140
I asked them about drape because presumably there are parts of the object that the gel won't be able to get into.

176
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,680


177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,380
So how does that affect
the use of the device?

178
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,190
- So we need the depth to
not be wider than the mark.

179
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,312
- Oh, okay.

180
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,910
- Say that was one millimeter
here and that was two.

181
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,830
What we would have is
the effect is we probably

182
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,300
get that deep.

183
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,800
We wouldn't get the corner.

184
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,170
But normally what the operator's looking

185
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:42,170
for is that value as opposed
to the the value of this area.

186
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:44,700
- So in terms of the application

187
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,983
- That's the important bit.

188
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:46,816
- Yeah, like the important bit

189
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,060
for me is, ooh, that looks pretty.

190
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,308
- That looks cool.

191
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:50,340
- Yeah yeah.

192
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,810
Here's some other cool things that we put

193
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,830
under the microscope.

194
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,250
This is some woven fabric
under the microscope.

195
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,170
This is a UK driver's license

196
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,450
and you can see there's
a slight emboss here

197
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,910
which you can't see with the naked eye.

198
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,740
This is a button battery, and what I like

199
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,200
about this shot is that
there's a bit of hair

200
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,670
and dust stuck to the gel, so
you can see how the gel moves

201
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,090
and warps around the object
as you press into it.

202
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,460
Here's a phone speaker under
a microscope, and you can see

203
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,890
that the screen protector
isn't quite lined up.

204
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,290
Here's a chip and pin from a credit card.

205
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,123
This is interesting.

206
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:25,590
It's a part that I had 3D printed

207
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,190
and you can see how the
printhead must have moved

208
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,660
as it was printing the thing.

209
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,130
It goes around the edge

210
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,490
and then it fills in in
this kind of zigzag motion.

211
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,842
How cool is that?

212
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:37,860
Can you guess what this one is?

213
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,690
It's my stubble.

214
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,039
Sorry about that.

215
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,359
This is a love heart,

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,210
and this is the take home
message of the video by the way,

217
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,043
just be you.

218
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,600
The gel pads get sticky
over time and need to

219
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,290
be replaced periodically, but
when it's a little bit sticky

220
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,872
the visuals are really interesting.

221
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:55,950
I really think this needs a sound effect.

222
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,000
You know what I mean?

223
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,550
The sponsor of this video
doesn't want your money.

224
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,070
In fact, maybe it wants to give you money.

225
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,980
If you are graduating
from high school in 2023

226
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,550
and you have an interest in
maths and or computer science

227
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,740
or you know someone with that profile

228
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,530
then this is a really
interesting opportunity.

229
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,050
Jane Street is a company
that solves problems

230
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,170

Oh, and that thing from the beginning

255
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,073
it's the inside of a quartz analog watch.

256
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,952
(upbeat music)
