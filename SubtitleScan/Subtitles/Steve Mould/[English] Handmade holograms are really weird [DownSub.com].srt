1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
- This is a hologram that I made by hand.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,190
This is also a handmade hologram,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,200
but as you can see, it was made by someone

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,030
who actually knows what they're doing.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,000
Both holograms were made
using the same technique,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,550
and this one and this one,

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,340
the technique is deceptively simple.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,670
You just make scratches
in a shiny surface.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,990
I made my holograms

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,560
on sheets of black
acrylic using a divider,

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,170
basically a compass where
both ends are pointy.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,100
These aren't like traditional
holograms like this one,

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,010
but these types of holograms
you get on credit cards

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,590
are the same as these handmade ones.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,990
It's just that the
etching is much smaller.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,460
One thing that's hard to appreciate

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,100
on video is that this thing is 3D.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,770
It appears to hover
below the acrylic plate.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,290
I can give you a sense of
that by tilting the thing

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,440
in front of the camera or
moving the camera side to side,

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,060
but to really appreciate it.

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,280
Here's a cross view stereogram.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,580
If you're able to go cross eyed
until the two images overlap

24
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,700
with each other, it should
pop out as a 3D image.

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,950
You know, while we're doing
the crossview stereogram thing

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,860
why don't I show you this
traditional hologram as well?

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,540
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,033
And here are those other etch holograms.

29
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,060
To show you how etch holograms
work and how to make them.

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,740
We'll start with a really simple

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,660
just a floating point of light

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,150
and then we'll work up to
something as complex as this.

33
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,950
To create a floating point of light

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,560
all you have to do is gently score an arc

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,820
into the acrylic sheet.

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,643
Now, if I put the camera
here and a light source here

37
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:36,780
then you can see that the light
glint off the etched line.

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,060
But what decides the
position of the glint?

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,900
Because look, as the camera
moves, the glint moves as well.

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,040
Well, the simplest way to think about it is that the etched groove is like a curved trough shaped mirror.

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,560


42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,470
like a curved trough shaped mirror.

43
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,980
I was gonna try and figure
out how to build a large one

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,800
of those so that you could
see what was going on.

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,870
But actually it pretty much acts the same

46
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,630
as a shiny tube like this one.

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,860
And this has the added benefit

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,170
of being able to change how bent it is.

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,350
See when the tube is straight,
the glint is always directly

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,259
in front of the light source,
wherever I put the camera.

51
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,610
But when the tube is curved

52
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,650
the glint doesn't travel as far

53
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,350
and the same thing happens
with the etch on the arc.

54
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,450
And that's really the
key to the whole thing

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,030
because your left eye sees this image

56
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,060
and your right eye sees this image.

57
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,070
And if your brain makes the assumption

58
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,860
that the glint is in fact an object

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,060
then your eyes will move so
as to converge on that object.

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,030
Just like how if you hold your
finger in front of your face

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,840
you'll see two fingers
until your eyes move inwards they converge on your finger.

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,090
they converge on your finger.

63
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,240
Then you see one finger
and two backgrounds

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,560
and the same thing is happening

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,110
with the glint except in
the opposite direction.

66
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,980
Your eyes have to move apart
to get the glint to overlap.

67
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,870
And of course, your
brain uses the position

68
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,350
of your eyes to figure out
how far away objects are.

69
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,600
So if your eyes have to move apart

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,550
to bring the two glints together

71
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,130
then that tells your brain
the glint is further away

72
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,480
than the surface of the acrylic.

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,313
The opposite happens

74
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,060
when you turn the arc upside down actually

75
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,090
and the glint appears to be
hovering above the acrylic.

76
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,010
If you want to make a more complex object

77
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,640
then you simply draw out your
shape and then create lots

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,130
and lots of points around your drawing,

79
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,500
creating an etch for each point.

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,270
You'll notice that the image is distorted

81
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,710
compared to the original.

82
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,840
And the distortion of the
image actually depends

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,300
on the location of the
light source and the camera.

84
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,260
From what I can tell, if it was possible to have the get a proper rendition of the image, but at that angle you get basically no glint at all.

85
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,320



86
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,110



87
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,970


88
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,560


89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,830
So there's a trade off, and if
I was gonna do this properly

90
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,760
I would pre warp the image
in the opposite direction

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,550
so that when the image became warped

92
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,070
by the viewing experience,

93
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,820
it would undo the pre-applied warp

94
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,960
and the image would look normal.

95
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,457
This is all well and good,
but you might be thinking,

96
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:03,180
"Hold on a second, this thing is flat."

97
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,250
Yes, it's floating below the acrylic,

98
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,080
but it's all at the same depth

99
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,510
and the drawing itself is two dimensional.

100
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,330
So how can we make this
hologram more interesting

101
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,850
by creating lines at different depths

102
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,240
and maybe even lines that plunge
in and out of the acrylic?

103
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,959
Well, one clue is to be found
in accidental etch holograms

104
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,880
that you may have
witnessed in your own life

105
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,860
like when you've run out of wiper fluid

106
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,560
but you use the windscreen wiper anyway,

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,740
the top of that bright line
appears to be further away

108
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,780
than the bottom of the bright line.

109
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,120
Similarly, if a metal
surface has been worked

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,730
in a circular motion
like this source panel

111
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,870
then you'll have a glint line

112
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,090
that appears to be
touching the metal surface

113
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,310
at the center of the circular work pattern

114
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,010
and move away as the light
glint moves outwards.

115
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,380
And that's because, well, it turns out

116
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,300
that the tighter the arc,

117
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,670
the closer the glint appears to be,

118
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,190
and the straighter the
arc, the further away

119
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,660
the glint appears to be.

120
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,250
And that makes sense because

121
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,220
if the arc was perfectly
straight at one extreme

122
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,150
well that's analogous

123
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,730
to the straight tube that I was holding

124
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,170
in front of the lights.

125
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,550
And in that situation

126
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,910
the glint is always directly
in front of the light source.

127
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,770
So when your eyes move to line

128
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,730
up the glint in that
scenario, they will converge

129
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,240
at the same depth as
the light source itself.

130
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,650
And then at the opposite end,

131
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,280
if the arc was so tight that
it was basically just a dot,

132
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,620
well the glint wouldn't
move at all relative

133
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,390
to the surface of the acrylic.

134
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,570
So it should appear to be at
the surface of the acrylic.

135
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,600
And so curvatures in
between those two extremes

136
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,730
will give you depths in between.

137
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,563
Here, for example

138
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:42,690
I've created a tilted
square where the top edge

139
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,490
of the square is further away.

140
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,370
So the top edge is created
with straighter arcs.

141
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,840
The sides of the square were much trickier

142
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,630
because each point along the
line was at a different depth.

143
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,640
So I had to adjust the divider

144
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,800
and change the position of the pivot point

145
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
as I went down the line.

146
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,910
By specifying where the
arcs start and stop.

147
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,880
You can have objects that
appear and disappear, depending

148
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,520
on the viewing angle, and
if you get it just right,

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,780
that means you can create opaque
objects with other objects

150
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,520
behind that you can only see
by looking around the corner.

151
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,950
Because the opaque square in
this hologram is quite close

152
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,270
to the surface of the acrylic.

153
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,400
In other words, I was
using quite short arcs.

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,830
You can actually see the
pivot points that I used

155
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,663
for the divider,

156
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,310
because it's created all these
little dots in the surface

157
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,040
and there are various techniques
you can use to prevent that

158
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,560
from happening, but it makes
the whole process a lot slower.

159
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,140
The final thing I wanted
to try was a hologram

160
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,020
of the corner of a cube sticking out.

161
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,890
This is a lot harder,

162
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,610
because all the lines are
changing death along their length

163
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,530
and it was really mind bending to try

164
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,030
and work out pivot position

165
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,450
and divider adjustment
for every single point.

166
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,700
I also wanted to see if I could have the actual tip of the cube poking out from the surface of the acrylic, which meant having some arcs that were upside down.

167
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,310


168
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,040


169
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,030
In the end, I made a bunch of mistakes and it was so hard to get to this point that I just rage quit on this particular hologram.

170
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,950


171
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,140


172
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,970
on this particular hologram.

173
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,250
So this is as much as you get of this one.

174
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,310
This is actually my attempt
to copy William J Beaty.

175
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,620
He discovered the divider
method independently.

176
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,453
Though he does mention

177
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,530
that he found some prior
literature on this subject.

178
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,300
Actually, he has some great advice

179
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,240
on things like etching
technique and stuff like that.

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,250
I'll leave a link to his website.

181
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,710
Actually, his YouTube
channel is brilliant too.

182
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,510
There's a link to that in
the description as well.

183
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,960
But anyway, as you can see,
I got part of the way there.

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,720
The bits that stick out from
the acrylic behave weirdly

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,580
and the glints are quite long.

186
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,730
I think that's an artifact of
the arcs being upside down.

187
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,890
I thought it would be
really cool to have a way

188
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,530
for people to be able to
share their own creations

189
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,470
like if you end up making
your own etch hologram.

190
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,330
So on my Discord server,

191
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,730
I've created a channel
specifically for that.

192
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,130
I've called it Science Fair Project.

193
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,530
So if you do end up
making an edge hologram

194
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,420
do hop over to my Discord server.

195
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,530
The link is in the description.

196
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,550
Now here's the question.

197
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,060
How do you get from this to this?

198
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,640
Well, this one was
created by Matthew Brand.

199
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,520
He really helped me to
understand what's going on,

200
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,290
linked to all his stuff
in the description.

201
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,240
Some of his creations
are for sale, in fact.

202
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,810
So one issue you may have
realized with these holograms

203
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,790
that you don't get with this hologram,

204
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,000
is the image warps and bends

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,720
in weird ways as you
change your viewing angle.

206
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,860
Matthew explained that that's

207
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,370
because actually an
arc is the wrong shape.

208
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,680
In fact, most people
creating etch holograms

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,300
aren't using the right shape.

210
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,120
They're all approximations
to the correct curve.

211
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,520
Matthew figured out what
that curve should be.

212
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,890
I won't go into the equations
or anything like that

213
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,659
but look, he kindly sent me this animation

214
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,239
of how you might create the correct curve.

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,100
So it's possible to do it mechanically

216
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,270
with the right linkages.

217
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,360
But actually what Matthew
did was create a CNC process.

218
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,720
So he defines the 3D shape
that he wants in software,

219
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,490
and then his code converts

220
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,530
that into the appropriate etching.

221
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,440
The etching is then carried
out by the computer.

222
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
It's really interesting

223
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,960
to just look at the etches themselves

224
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,640
because there would be no way of knowing

225
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,850
just looking at this mess
here, that this would pop out

226
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,150
into a 3D shape with an
appropriate light source.

227
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,520
This is a depiction of
Borromean rings, by the way.

228
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,590
So here's a quick tangent about that,

229
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,580
because they're really cool.

230
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,910
It's possible to link
three closed loops together

231
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,760
in such a way that no two
loops are linked together

232
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,340
meaning if you break any
one of the three loops

233
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,460
the other two come apart,
and that's Borromean rings.

234
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,930
What about those vinyl records?

235
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,700
Well, earlier I said that the arc

236
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,070
of a circle is not the right shape

237
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,580
for the etch because it
causes warping and distortion,

238
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,390
except under very specific
circumstances where the arc

239
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,000
of a circle is the right
shape for the edge line.

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,820
And that specific circumstance
is when the etch goes

241
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,020
in a full circle

242
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,280
and the image rotates once for
every rotation of the circle.

243
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,350
And that fact has been used beautifully

244
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,830
in these commemorative
Star Wars vinyl records.

245
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,560
I really like it when
a new service pops up

246
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,010
and you look at what they
offer and you think, yeah,

247
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,960
that makes logical sense.

248
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,910
That thing should exist.

249
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,240
Like maybe there's a task
that you don't want to do,

250
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,340
but you know that you should do it

251
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,850
and now you can pay this
company to do it for you.

252
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,830
And that's exactly the logic

253
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,650
behind this sponsor of
this video, Incogni.

254
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,940
Here's what Incogni does.

255
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,020
There are these companies

256
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,630
called data brokers
that collect information

257
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,510
about you and then sell that
information to other people.

258
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,060
You don't know who they're selling it to,

259
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,227
but you can contact them and say,

260
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:34,950
"Please stop and actually delete my data."

261
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,560
The problem is there are
thousands of these companies

262
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,800
and they all want to be
contacted in different ways

263
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,350
and sometimes they'll reject your request

264
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,150
and you have to make an appeal.

265
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,120
Well, Incogni have figured
out what needs to be done

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,940
for each one of those
thousands of companies.

267
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,930
So one service has done
all the hard work upfront.

268
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,170
So now I can just sign up to Incogni

269
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,240
give them permission to act on my behalf

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
and they just take care of it.

271
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
I've been with Incogni for a little while,

272
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,060
so I can show you the progress.

273
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,310
Look, these are all the
companies that have confirmed

274
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,800
that they now don't have my data.

275
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,910
The thing that really annoys me

276
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,250
about these companies
is I'll get a phone call

277
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,800
and they'll know my full
name and they want to talk

278
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,780
about life insurance
or something like that.

279
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,590
And I just think, how did
you get this data about me?

280
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,570
And typically, there's no way to find out

281
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,442
but you can make it stop.

282
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,650
I just know myself well enough

283
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,040
that I will never go
through that manual process.

284
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,840
I mean, it would take months anyway.

285
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,230
And in that sense, I'm the
perfect demographic for Incogni

286
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,760
and maybe you are too.

287
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
