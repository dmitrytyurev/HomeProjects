1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,330
- [Steve] This is a strip
of self-healing polymer.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,210
That means I can slice it into two pieces,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,820
and then with the application
of gentle pressure,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,620
push the two pieces together,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,453
and it'll become,

6
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:14,370
once again, one single piece.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,577
At first, you might think,

8
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:17,497
"Well, that's not so unusual,

9
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:19,567
"like, if I took a strip of Blu Tack

10
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,097
"and slice that into two pieces,

11
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:23,107
"and then press those two pieces together,

12
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:23,977
"I would, once again,

13
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:26,550
"have a single piece of Blu Tack."

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,383
You might also say,

15
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:29,347
"Look, if I have two droplets of water,

16
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:30,217
"and I push them together,

17
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:32,549
"they become a single droplet of water."

18
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,990
The difference between Blu Tack

19
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,340
and this self-healing polymer

20
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,330
is that, well,

21
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,130
Blu Tack is sticky,

22
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,210
it sticks to my hand,

23
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,590
it sticks to a wall,

24
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,630
it sticks to the back of this picture

25
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,100
of Patrick Stewart.

26
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,690
So, it's not surprising

27
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,180
that Blu Tack sticks to itself,

28
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,060
but this polymer isn't sticky.

29
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,860
The same goes for droplets of water,

30
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,380
they're sticky and they flow,

31
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,640
because they're a liquid,

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,880
so, we should naturally
expect different behavior

33
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,290
from droplets of water,

34
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,140
as we do from a strip of polymer.

35
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,240
We can actually flip this
question on its head,

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,297
instead of saying,

37
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:09,180
"Why is this polymer self-healing?"

38
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,013
We can say,

39
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,427
"Why aren't other things self-healing?

40
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:14,190
"Why isn't metal self-healing?"

41
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,890
Like, if I cut this piece of metal in two,

42
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,040
why is it that I can't just
push the two ends together,

43
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,160
and it fuses back into
a single piece of metal?

44
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,750
Like, if you think about what's happening

45
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,610
at the molecular level,

46
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,240
a metal is a lattice of ions

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,530
in a cloud of mobile electrons.

48
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,740
So, if you slice this lattice in two,

49
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,560
and bring those two ends back together,

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,430
well, (chuckles) to me,

51
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,340
that looks like a single metal lattice,

52
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,800
so, why doesn't it become one?

53
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,670
In the case of metal,

54
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,650
the answer's actually
quite straightforward,

55
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,090
it's oxidation.

56
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,010
I've got some sodium metal here,

57
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,230
which is soft enough to cut with a knife,

58
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,190
and when I do,

59
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,160
you can see it's actually
a really shiny metal,

60
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,750
but that doesn't last forever,

61
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,920
it doesn't take long

62
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,460
for that shiny surface to
become dull in appearance.

63
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,380
That's because the metal is reacting

64
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,419
with oxygen in the air.

65
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,679
Actually, the same thing happens

66
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,180
when you cut any metal,

67
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,240
it's just that that oxidation
layer isn't as visible

68
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,430
in the case of, say, steel,

69
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,290
as compared to sodium.

70
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,790
So, it's understandable then

71
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,680
that if you took two pieces of metal

72
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,030
and pushed them together,

73
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,820
they wouldn't form one
single piece of metal,

74
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,370
because there is a layer of oxidized metal

75
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,780
in between.

76
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,510
In fact, if you were
to cut a piece of metal

77
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,250
in the vacuum of space,

78
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,310
and then push those cut surfaces together,

79
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,680
they would fuse together.

80
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,513
We know this,

81
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:43,440
because it's happened in situations

82
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,390
when we don't want it to happen,

83
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,770
at least, once.

84
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,210
In April, 1991,

85
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,100
the Galileo spacecraft

86
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,040
was supposed to open
its high-gain antenna,

87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,450
looks a bit like an umbrella,

88
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,670
but three ribs of that umbrella

89
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,030
had cold welded to the
body of the spacecraft,

90
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,620
and so, it couldn't open.

91
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,820
This stuff is a bit different

92
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,440
to a metal, though,

93
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,700
because it's a polymer,

94
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,910
so, it would be more like
if I cut a piece of plastic

95
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,200
into two pieces,

96
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,750
and then try to push
those two pieces together.

97
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,770
In this case, clearly,

98
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,540
they don't fuse back together.

99
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,950
And I suppose that makes sense,

100
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,080
like, if you're cutting
a piece of plastic in two

101
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,470
then you're cutting through
individual polymer chains,

102
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,320
you're breaking bonds
between carbon atoms.

103
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
When you break a covalent bond like this,

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,590
you're left with radicals,

105
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,620
that's atoms that have
unpaired valence electrons,

106
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,880
they're incredibly reactive,

107
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,270
so, we should expect the
exposed surface atoms

108
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,050
to react with molecules in the atmosphere,

109
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,790
or if it was in a vacuum,

110
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,870
I imagine, they would react
with the atoms around them

111
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,850
in the substance itself,

112
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,810
and so, that exposed
surface becomes unreactive.

113
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,310
It's not sticky anymore.

114
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,620
If you press those two surfaces together,

115
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,230
those bonds aren't going to reform,

116
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,160
unless you can introduce quite
a high activation energy.

117
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,070
So, why is it then that
I can cut this material

118
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,270
into two pieces,

119
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,800
push the two pieces together,

120
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,500
and it reforms into a single piece?

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,690
Well, the full explanation it seems

122
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,120
is hidden behind trade secrets,

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,399
but there is some information out there.

124
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,429
I want to announce this
Patreon exclusive live Q and A

125
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,690
I'm doing on Monday,

126
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,010
the 20th of June,

127
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,170
but I don't know where
to put it in the video.

128
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,460
Put it anywhere.

129
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,050
Okay, thanks, Patrick.

130
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,390
Not all self-healing
polymers are the same,

131
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,590
and it seems that there are,

132
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,780
at least, two possible explanations

133
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,120
for what's happening with this one.

134
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,940
The first is a polymerization reaction,

135
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,910
and the second is a crosslinking reaction.

136
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,130
A polymerization reaction
is just a reaction

137
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,830
that joins lots of small
molecules together,

138
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,020
into long chain molecules,

139
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,250
into polymers.

140
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,830
It can also be when you take
two existing polymer chains

141
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,250
and join them together into
one longer polymer chain,

142
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,990
and that's potentially what's happening

143
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,610
with this self-healing polymer.

144
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,550
When you bring two surfaces together,

145
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,790
some of the ends of the
polymers on one surface

146
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,430
are joining to some of
the ends of the polymers

147
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,260
on the other surface,

148
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,630
creating longer polymer chains

149
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,180
that span the break.

150
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,410
Unlike with the plastic,

151
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,660
this polymerization reaction can happen

152
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,770
at room temperature,

153
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,020
perhaps because when
you break the polymers,

154
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,230
you're not left with
highly reactive radicals,

155
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,950
or perhaps because of the
presence of a catalyst.

156
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,330
Actually, that might explain

157
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,640
why the polymer isn't sticky.

158
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,730
If the catalyst has a high specificity

159
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,940
to that particular
polymerization reaction,

160
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,130
and very few others,

161
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,480
that would explain why
it's only sticky to itself.

162
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,590
The second possibility,

163
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,910
crosslinking, is what happens

164
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,460
when you have lots of individual chains,

165
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,560
and you link them together

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,470
at different positions along the chain.

167
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,710
Like, for example, I've got
loads of little chains here,

168
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,380
and maybe I'm gonna join
these two chains together

169
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,310
at this point,

170
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,750
these two chains together at this point,

171
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,740
and so on.

172
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,110
Crosslinking strengthens a polymer.

173
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,740
For example, I've got
this liquid latex here,

174
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,230
it's liquid, because the
individual polymer chains

175
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,840
are able to slide over each other,

176
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
but I can cause crosslinks to form

177
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,560
between these separate chains

178
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,240
by changing the pH.

179
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
So, by adding vinegar,

180
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,830
for example, I turn this liquid latex

181
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,170
into a bouncy ball.

182
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,900
It's interesting to think that before,

183
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,090
I had lots of individual molecules,

184
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,150
and now, I have one giant molecule,

185
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,890
the size of a bouncy ball.

186
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,220
And this is true for
things like car tires.

187
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,550
This car tire is one giant molecule.

188
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,710
How does this relate to
self-healing polymers?

189
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,810
Well, when two surfaces of the polymer

190
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,920
are brought together,

191
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,420
chains on one surface,

192
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,220
and chains on the other surface,

193
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,540
come into contact,

194
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,030
and a crosslinking reaction occurs.

195
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,920
It's interesting that
that reaction can happen

196
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,000
at room temperature.

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,410
And it's interesting that the polymer

198
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,810
is able to create bonds with itself,

199
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,910
but not other things.

200
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,040
It's interesting that it's not sticky.

201
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,420
Whether it's a crosslinking reaction

202
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,920
or a polymerization reaction,

203
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,320
the explanation for why this substance

204
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,760
is only sticky to itself,

205
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,840
and not other things,

206
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,630
seems to be in the molecular detail,

207
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,540
and that detail seems
to be a trade secret.

208
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,500
But I'll keep digging,

209
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,970
and if I find out any more,

210
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,350
I'll tell you.

211
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,480
Actually, there is a third possibility,

212
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,550
but I don't think it's
what's going on here,

213
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,980
and that is micro encapsulation.

214
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,830
You have these tiny microcapsules

215
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,870
throughout the substance,

216
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,710
and inside those capsules is
some kind of sticky substance,

217
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,110
some kind of glue type of thing,

218
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,910
or maybe a catalyst,

219
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,290
or something like that.

220
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,520
When the material is damaged,

221
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,800
it tears open those microcapsules,

222
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,650
and the content spills
out and gets to work,

223
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,030
healing the damage.

224
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,530
You can buy something quite similar

225
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,060
from a standard hardware store,

226
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,220
usually, called self amalgamating tape,

227
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,760
but the fusing isn't quite so good,

228
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,500
but it's a similar idea.

229
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,480
This video is sponsored by Wondrium.

230
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
You may have heard me talk

231
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,850
about The Great Courses Plus before,

232
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,890
well, they've rebranded to Wondrium,

233
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,080
because they do a bunch more stuff now.

234
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,060
The service is now much broader,

235
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,520
and it's much deeper than it was.

236
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,770
They've still got those
educational courses

237
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,820
that they've always had,

238
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,860
but they also have long-form videos,

239
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,120
short-form videos,

240
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,340
how-tos, documentaries,

241
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,810
travel logs, things like that.

242
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,090
The courses are more academically comprehensive than ever before,

243
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,923
than ever before,

244
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:32,100
but they're still presented

245
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,320
by these really engaging experts,

246
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,799
and the content is thoughtfully curated.

247
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,359
Couple of things that blew my mind

248
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,980
recently on Wondrium,

249
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,570
Olbers' Paradox.

250
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,400
Olbers' Paradox states that,

251
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,520
given everything we
know about the universe,

252
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,010
the night sky shouldn't be dark

253
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,260
with pin-points of light,

254
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,780
the whole night sky should be bright,

255
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,680
but it isn't.

256
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,940
And the paradox is solved,

257
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,830
interestingly, by the Big Bang.

258
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,870
Another mind-blowing thing that I learnt,

259
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,380
you can float a cruise
ship on a gallon of water,

260
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,120
the question is, how do you do it?

261
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,590
I recommend you have a
look around this site,

262
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,480
