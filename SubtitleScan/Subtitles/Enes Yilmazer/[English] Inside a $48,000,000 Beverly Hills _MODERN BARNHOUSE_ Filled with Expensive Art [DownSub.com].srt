1
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:19,486
Hey, everyone.
Welcome to Beverly Hills.

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,700
Today we're checking out this gorgeous

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,380
contemporary barn house designed
and built by Nobel LA.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,300
Nestled in a canyon,
surrounded by beautiful trees

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,860
and landscape, this home is a wonderful
blend of organic materials,

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,340
sleek contemporary lines furnished
and decorated by stunning art pieces.

7
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,820
Now, everyone knows that we go out of our way to showcase some of the best properties in the world.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,540


9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,380
But this week we got lucky,

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,400
as one of those homes happens to be
in our backyard here in Beverly Hills.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,243
So without further ado,
let's go check out this stunning home.

12
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:43,180
All right everyone, let's start our
tour with the exterior.

13
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,371
I'm currently on top of the staircase.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,060
Right in front of me is the front door
that we're going to check out in a bit.

15
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,643
But first I want to turn back
and look at this stunning estate.

16
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,290
Right in front of us.

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,700
We have the pool area.
Looks incredible.

18
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,900
You have your long driveway bringing up to
the motor court, which is down below us.

19
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,900
And the house itself is a beautiful

20
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,140
contemporary barn house with this vertically installed reclaimed siding.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,660
You have your steel case doors

22
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,980
and windows, steep roof lines,
three car garages down below.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,420
We got a lot of details to cover today,
and we're going to talk more about

24
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,757
the grounds and the exterior
later in the tour.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,629
Now follow me this way to the front entry.

26
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,940
This has to be the tallest front door
we have ever seen on our channel.

27
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,929
This is insane.

28
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,340
- [Mikey] Yeah, this must be
at least 25, 30ft tall.

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,780
This is wild.
- [Enes] At least.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,610
And then if you think this entry and this

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,380
front door is impressive, come
on in and check out this stunning foyer.

32
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,610
Double height ceilings,
exposed roof rafters.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,220
Then we have these steel columns and beams here, beautiful marble floors.

34
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,180
You have steel case doors and windows

35
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,700
throughout, bringing
so much natural light.

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,020
And on my right hand side,

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,100
we have this stunning staircase curving
beautifully to the second floor landing.

38
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,229
And below that is this
art piece right here.

39
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,700
This is by Kaws.

40
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,580
It's called compliance.

41
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,220
They have it three in black
and three in pink.

42
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,340
And that's it, really.
Exactly.

43
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,380
And one of them is here,

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,900
sitting on this beautiful stand
custom designed by Nobel LA.

45
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,860
You can see the lighting below as
well as on top around the art piece.

46
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,729
And it looks incredible
with a staircase on the back.

47
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:37,460
Over the last four years,
we've seen a lot of different homes,

48
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,000
assets all around the world,
but somehow you always come up

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,700
with designs that are very
distinct to yourself.

50
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,900
Thank you.
Tell us what we're looking at today.

51
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,780
- [Max] This is my vision
of the modern barn house.

52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,300
We're in the main living room right now.

53
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,020
Two story ceilings and very open volume.

54
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,100
I love art.

55
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,580
I love beautiful and perfect
interiors and architecture.

56
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,580
So art is mine.

57
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,480
I stage it, I take it.

58
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,820
But this is my vision.

59
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:20,329
I just want to show here in the project,
how the art will complement this interior.

60
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,900
- [Enes] Now, follow me this way.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,700
Let's take this walkway.

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,580
There's a staircase here that goes
down to the lower level.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,380
And then we have this opening taking
us to the formal dining room.

64
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,820
I really like the way
they laid out this room.

65
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,900
Right in the center,

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,959
we have a Henge dining table,

67
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:42,476
eight chairs from Minotti,
Henge chandelier above,

68
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,420
this section looks gorgeous.

69
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,660
Then on the right hand side,

70
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,180
you can see this wall with oak paneling
running all the way to the ceiling.

71
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,540
Then we have these brass
dividers, on the floors.

72
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,540
You can see the recessed in lights
to light up the texture on this wall.

73
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,740
And they even have a marble
incorporated to this side.

74
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,940
So you have all these different
materials coming together really nicely.

75
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,720
Now, on this side,
we have steel case French doors opening up

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,580
to the front of the home
and to the pool area.

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,540
And lastly, on this side,
we have this beautiful glass display

78
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,300
Rimadesio doors with cloth
in the glass to create some texture.

79
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,100
And inside of these drawers, you actually have this lightbox design to just elevate the mood in this room.

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,940


81
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,620
And Mikey, let's turn it off.

82
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,500
When you turn off the light box,
it turns into a mirror.

83
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,780
Very cool.
How cool is that?

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,660
So elegant.
So sleek.

85
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,140
Look at the floors of Mikey.

86
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,420
They have the AC diffusers
nicely recessed in.

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
They actually make these outlet covers out

88
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,380
of marble slabs, and they
just create the openings.

89
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,540
Looks beautiful.

90
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,300
And this way, your ceilings can
stay very minimalist as well.

91
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,820
And this is your dining room.
Pretty awesome.

92
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,260
Now follow me this way.

93
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,660
Going through this opening,

94
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,580
we have the kitchen on our left hand side,
family room on our right hand side.

95
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,060
And it's another beautiful
space in this property.

96
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,220
Now, before we continue our tour, I want
to talk about the specs of this home.

97
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,420
So we have six bedrooms,
eleven bathrooms,

98
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,276
16,390 sqft of interior space,

99
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:23,543
over two acres of land,
and on the market for $48 million.

100
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,780
I want to give big thanks to Max Nobel

101
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,900
and his team at Nobel LA
for making this tour possible.

102
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,340
This is a stunning home.
And as always,

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,060
you can find more information about this
listing in the description of this video.

104
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,214
Make sure to check it out.

105
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,580
When I look at your homes,
I see a lot of custom pieces.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,580
And when I say custom, they're literally
fabricated specifically for this house.

107
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,300
Half of your kitchen is fully designed
by you, not just cabinet selection.

108
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,580
Those islands are literally
fabricated by your team.

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,060
How do you go about
fabricating these pieces?

110
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,029
And is it a lot of trouble
to design these elements?

111
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,020
- [Max] We have a full team of 40 people
designing technical drawings.

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,300
Architects.

113
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,300
And everybody is passionate
about creating something unique.

114
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,429
That's why we all come into the design,
to create something new.

115
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,660
So we go room by room,

116
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,657
and we understand first what
people would ask from this room.

117
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,460
First of all, what will be logistics

118
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,830
throughout the house,

119
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,470
how they're going to use it
and who will be their guests or.

120
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:35,743
- [Enes] How they're going to
flow through the space.

121
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:36,740
- [Max] How they're going to flow.

122
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,900
So we want to think about all these

123
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,171
details first and then
make a design element.

124
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,340
Let's continue our tour with the kitchen.

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,620
Beautiful space.

126
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,420
We have two islands here,

127
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,940
and the way these islands
are designed is very unique.

128
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,220
The first one up front is all wrapped
with brass with these grid details.

129
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,740
Looks so contemporary.

130
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,020
Marble countertops.

131
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,700
You have your fabricated sink. Incorporated drying rack here.

132
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,620


133
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,860
Looks beautiful.

134
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,420
Above we can see these pendant lights or chandeliers.

135
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,740
These are from Henge.

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,820
And we have seen these
light fixtures before.

137
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,829
- [Mikey] They look familiar.

138
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,400
In Dubai.
Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:21,771
- [Enes] Second property that we toured.

140
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,060
- [Mikey] They had a lot of Henge pieces
in that house as well.

141
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,580
Now that you say that, I do remember it.
- [Enes] Correct.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,420
And before we move on from this island,

143
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,780
I want to mention we
have a dishwasher here.

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,740
And within the drying rack, we also
have this incorporated cutting board.

145
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,340
- [Mikey] I love that.

146
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,020
It is a solid slab of marble and it moves
back and forth so quietly and easily.

147
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,699
I love this detail, too.
Yeah.

148
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,580
- [Enes] Now, on the other side,
we have the second island.

149
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,960
This one is fabricated out of marble,
including the drawer fronts.

150
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,380
And check this out. It's all vein matched.

151
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,820
And in order to keep the weight down
and make these doors really functional,

152
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,540
they actually incorporate the wood
cabinetry in the marble slab.

153
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,000
And look how many pieces of hardware they

154
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,913
had to have in order to operate
this door and make it soft close.

155
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,140
Looks beautiful.

156
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,700
I love this piece here.

157
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,740
Then you have your incorporated
sink and wrapping around.

158
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,100
All the cabinetry that's
on the walls are Poliform.

159
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,380
You have your Gaggenau
built-in appliances here.

160
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,029
Espresso maker in the center.

161
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,300
This is the freezer.

162
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,614
And we have the fridge on this side.

163
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,100
Nicely decorated.

164
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,620
- [Mikey] It has been a while since we've
opened a fridge on one of our tours.

165
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,580
Occasionally they'll have these really

166
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,980
beautifully staged
refrigerators, full of drinks.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,060
So we have to show them.
- [Enes] We have to.

168
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,100
Now, the other side of the island, again,
you have your fabricated sink here.

169
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,940
These are Dornbracht fixtures
with a titanium finish.

170
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,140
Super sleek and contemporary.

171
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,340
You have another built-in drying rack.

172
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,540
This is a lazy susan.

173
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,020
You can move around the kitchen
and just have it to your utility.

174
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,100
Let's talk about this
pet gas cooktop design.

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,260
We have seen this before.

176
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,500
We have seen it on the other property

177
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,643
that we toured that was
built by Max, remember?

178
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,471
Incorporated gas cooktops
within the countertop.

179
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:09,180
- [Mikey] Yeah.

180
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,300
Not to detract from the tour too much,
but I loved that house.

181
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,020
It was really cool.
It had that massive what?

182
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,700
Brass fireplace, right?
- [Enes] Correct.

183
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,700
Yeah.
Stunning home in Hidden Hills.

184
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,500
That was also built by Max.

185
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,140
And you have your pop up vent.

186
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,820
This also contrasts very nicely
with the countertops, too.

187
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,860
And then you come over here.

188
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,857
We have a built-in floating or cantilevered dining area.

189
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,160
Now, I said cantilevered,

190
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,886
because if you look below, you will
realize that there are no columns.

191
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:44,540
This section here sits on a steel beam
that runs underneath this dining area

192
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,780
into the cabinetry and all the way
down to the floor trusses.

193
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,140
So it's really bolted into the ground.

194
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,220
That's how they accomplish this look.

195
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,463
And it has no deflection.

196
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,596
It's super strong.

197
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:57,540
- [Mikey] No give at all?

198
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,740
- [Enes] No give at all.

199
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,843
Looks beautiful.

200
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,260
And these are the islands
and your wall cabinets.

201
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,514
Now it gets better,
follow me this way.

202
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,180
Chef's kitchen, pretty nice.

203
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,540
It's all stainless steel,
commercial grade.

204
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,260
You have your gas stove, sink, dishwasher,
another fridge and freezer.

205
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:19,042
Some open shelving and I want to say.

206
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,180
They just finished this home.

207
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,100
They're still putting some

208
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,540
of the finishing touches,
and it's not even on the market yet.

209
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,620
We just got an opportunity to tour it, and
we're leaving for Europe in a few days.

210
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,500
So we wanted to make sure we captured
this stunning home before we leave.

211
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,229
- [Mikey] Yeah.

212
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,220
- [Enes] Now, this is
the informal dining area.

213
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,057
We have a circular table in the center,
seating for six.

214
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:42,971
Gorgeous light fixtures above.

215
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:50,180
It looks like a Hermes belt wrapping
that I'm assuming alabaster light fixture.

216
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,780
And it looks beautiful.

217
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,940
And then you have all these steel case

218
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,340
French doors opening up to your
grounds, to your side yard.

219
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,100
Really nice.

220
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,060
All right, that's it for the
kitchen and the dining area.

221
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,620
Now let's take everybody to the other side
so we can check out this family room,

222
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,443
which is one of my favorite
areas in this house.

223
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,220
We got to talk about this
massive L shaped Minotti couch.

224
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,300
Look at the shelf here.

225
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,600
It's all leather wrapped.

226
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,740
The materials they used to fabricate
this piece, it's very minimalist.

227
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,260
Then you come over here.

228
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,220
We have two gorgeous leather chairs,

229
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,043
floor lamps, french doors
opening up to the grounds.

230
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,060
Great natural light coming in,
oak panels on the walls.

231
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,540
And then your eyes are drawn to this
section here, which looks fantastic.

232
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,260
Fireplace right in the center.

233
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,620
Look how they fabricated the marble
and incorporated all these grits.

234
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,540
And I have to show this detail.

235
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,460
That's your future TV connection.

236
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,620
- [Mikey] I noticed this yesterday.

237
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,043
I really liked that Max did not want
to put a TV here for showing the home.

238
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:56,700
But at the same time, he cares so much.

239
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
He doesn't want anyone actually ruining

240
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,460
the marble and putting
their own holes in it, so.

241
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,660
Precisely.
Exactly.

242
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,500
He wanted to give people
an option to put a TV here.

243
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,100
- [Enes] Exactly.
And look at all the built-ins.

244
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,300
Look how all these different materials
come together to create these sections.

245
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:18,020
You have brass dividers, wooden shelves,
LED lighting, stone on the back.

246
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,914
And it's filled with art pieces,
Bearbricks, accessories.

247
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,260
It's a really unique,

248
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,180
almost an aggressive take
on a contemporary design.

249
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,820
But the way Max designs it,
he always pulls it off.

250
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,300
- [Mikey] Yeah, it looks incredible.

251
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,340
- [Enes] It looks incredible.

252
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,580
This is your family room.

253
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,920
And to me, what I really like about it is

254
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,580
the fact that you can just open up these
French doors that are custom to this house

255
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,580
with these custom leather handles,
and you just walk to your grounds.

256
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,357
Pretty amazing.

257
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,060
Now let's go back to the hallway again.

258
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,620
I want to quickly take everybody

259
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,820
to the dining area because we're
actually not done here so far.

260
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,940
We have seen all the common areas
that are on this side of the home.

261
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,780
And for these spaces, you got to have a bathroom. And they actually have one right behind this concealed pivot door.

262
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,643


263
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,500
It actually opens up to this space first,
where we have this fabricated sink.

264
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,540
And I'm really going to take my time
to talk about this piece here.

265
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,700
These are all marble slabs.

266
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,380
Right in the center,
we have a hidden drain.

267
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,620
And these marble slabs
are all different sizes.

268
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,420
They have chiseled edges.

269
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,057
And Max and his team create these technical drawings for these vanities.

270
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:33,340
Then overseas, these pieces get fabricated, and then they ship it over here.

271
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,329


272
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,786
It gets all put together, and that's how
you accomplish this custom vanity piece.

273
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,260
It's so cool.
Look at the faucet here.

274
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,380
Then we have a massive window on the back,

275
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,300
modern light fixture above,
mirror on the side.

276
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,057
All of it coming together.

277
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,500
What an amazing moment in this home.

278
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,620
And, yeah, this is the first vanity.
By the way.

279
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,180
You go to the other side.

280
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,020
This is where we have
the actual powder bathroom.

281
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,980
They have another vanity here.

282
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,860
This one is also fabricated.

283
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,140
And these reeded details actually
run all the way to the walls.

284
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,629
You have your sink, Gessi fixtures,
wall mounted toilet.

285
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,457
Look how nice
this powder bathroom is.

286
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:18,580
- [Mikey] really cool.

287
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,820
I love all the stone.

288
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,260
And obviously, all the light
fixtures are really awesome.

289
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,460
- [Enes] Beautiful.
Just beautiful.

290
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,800
All right, let's go back
to the hallway again.

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,940
Now I want to bring everybody back,
to the entry and the formal living room.

292
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,420
We briefly covered some
of the details here.

293
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,580
I want to take a moment to talk about

294
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,057
the staircase design, which is a very
important element of this entry.

295
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,300
It's mostly made out of brass and how they

296
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,100
fabricated the brass around this curve
with different sizes and dimensions.

297
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,260
Then we have recessed in floor
lights to highlight the texture here.

298
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,260
And because we have great ceiling heights

299
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:03,700
and this darker plaster backdrop,
all of it coming together makes this

300
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,020
staircase so dramatic
and all the way to details.

301
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,660
Even the handrail is wrapped
with leather, and it's gorgeous.

302
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,220
And just going up to the second
floor is an experience.

303
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,940
Look at this.
- [Mikey] It's incredible.

304
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,900
- [Enes] It's incredible.

305
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,071
Now let's go to the other side so we
can check out this formal living room.

306
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,220
Look at this glass door assembly here.

307
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,520
It's actually two French doors opening up
the front facing balcony where you can

308
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,060
look down to your grounds
and your motor court.

309
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,700
Great natural light coming in.

310
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,000
Two Minotti couches, coffee tables,
accessories, details.

311
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,100
Volume here is just incredible.

312
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,340
And just like the rest of the home,
a lot of different art pieces.

313
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,660
These are all Kaws, by the way.

314
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,780
It's so impressive.

315
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,000
And light fixtures above us,

316
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:56,300
and how this second floor
bridge curves so beautifully.

317
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,571
And all these different components
and angles,

318
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,943
and architectural lines coming together

319
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:02,780
is what makes
this home so unique.

320
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,660
What makes this space so unique.

321
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,420
These marble floors are silver roots.

322
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,180
And before we wrap up,

323
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,557
let's check out this intimate
seating area with a fireplace.

324
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,329
Built-ins on each side.

325
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:17,530
And talking about different
materials coming together.

326
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,980
We have a light box design on the back,
brass dividers, stone shelves.

327
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,500
And you have marble here
with more brass details.

328
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,980
And all of these different components

329
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,090
coming together, even though
they're from different brands.

330
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,957
And creating this seamless and very cohesive design

331
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,771
is not an easy thing to do,
but they pulled it off really well here.

332
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,980
When I look at your design elements,

333
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,057
you also use a lot of
different manufacturers,

334
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,940
and you somehow blend them,

335
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,671
install them, or incorporate them
in a way that it feels very cohesive.

336
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,700
How do you accomplish that harmony in your

337
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:01,086
design, even though you're
using countless manufacturers?

338
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:03,530
- [Max] We really spent
a lot of time on it.

339
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,530
But what we love to do
is this complication.

340
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,700
I don't know why.
- [Enes] It challenges you.

341
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,770
We love the complication about having
four different vendors creating one wall.

342
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:24,140
So you will see the element when
the marble is going into the brass panel,

343
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,420
is going into the wood panel, that would
have an understructure behind it.

344
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,570
And then another element of brass.

345
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,050
And then a wine room.

346
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,460
All the four manufacturers in one spot.

347
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,460
And each element has its own

348
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,530
understructure, it has its own
backing, it has its own depth.

349
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,940
And we love to put it all together

350
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,086
on the technical drawings
to have that deep, beautiful element.

351
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,620
All right, Mikey, let's take
everybody back to the hallway.

352
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,371
Another detail I want to point out.

353
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,380
So far, we passed through
two different points.

354
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,570
This is the third one.

355
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,220
Even these hallway openings are wrapped

356
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,740
with marble, and you
can see it closer here.

357
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,290
Now, few details on this side.

358
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,010
Number one, let's get a close up.

359
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,220
This brand is called Meljac.

360
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,800
These are these custom light switches.
Sound incredible.

361
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,840
It's like out of a plane.

362
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,140
- [Mikey] They're very satisfying.

363
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,386
- [Enes] Super satisfying.

364
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,530
Another concealed door
that matches the wall paneling.

365
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,043
And going in, we have the second
powder bathroom here.

366
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,500
Fabricated vanity.

367
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,050
You can actually see
the fluted details here.

368
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,770
Even the drain cover has
Nobel branding on it.

369
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,900
Copper fixtures, circular
mirror with LED lighting.

370
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,570
Another light fixture here.

371
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,786
And to bring more flair to this powder bathroom, we have this three dimensional wall made out of walnut.

372
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:48,740


373
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,858
That looks so cool.

374
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,290
- [Mikey] Yeah, I really like this.

375
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,860
It almost looks like the surface
of water just in the waves.

376
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,660
And we'll see something like this in
the primary bedroom a little bit later.

377
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,740
- [Enes] Correct.
We'll see that in a second.

378
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,943
Now let's go back to the hallway.

379
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,457
On our right hand side,
we have the secondary staircase landing

380
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,486
going down to the lower level
as well as the second floor.

381
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,530
A beautiful piece from Huckins.

382
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,050
This is a lot of fun.

383
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,810
Look at the scale of this
piece, by the way.

384
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,743
- [Mikey] Tsar nicholas, I believe.

385
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,257
Possible.
Yeah.

386
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,380
- [Enes] Now,
I'm looking for a door handle.

387
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:28,050
This is the only guest suite
that we have on this level.

388
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,090
Now, I'm really going to take my time

389
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,514
to talk about why this room
is designed the way it is.

390
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,050
When you own a property like this,

391
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,214
the caliber of guests that you're going
to have here is going to be quite high.

392
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,090
So you want to make sure when you
accommodate them,

393
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,500
you can give them a space that not only
they can stay, but they feel comfortable

394
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,180
that they can work in while
interacting with the property.

395
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,250
So this may seem like a junior primary
bedroom, but it's actually a proper suite.

396
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,860
We have a seating area here,

397
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:04,000
TV is behind Mikey, two separate walk-in
closets that are very spacious.

398
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,700
Then you come over to this side, dedicated
office area with a massive desk.

399
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,380
Another TV on this side,
some open shelving beautiful accessories.

400
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,700
And then you walk this way.

401
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,810
Then you come to your king size bed,

402
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,050
oak panels on the back, mood lighting,
your automatic shades and blackouts.

403
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,740
You have French doors here opening
up to a front facing balcony.

404
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,250
This window here faces the motor court.

405
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,290
That way, when you come to this property

406
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,729
and when you stay in this guest suite,
you have your whole experience covered.

407
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,660
You can entertain, work, sleep,
open up your door, go to the grounds,

408
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,010
and not only be part of this estate,
but you still have your zone.

409
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,940
And to me, this looks like a penthouse
suite at a Mandarin hotel in the UK.

410
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,860
Somewhere very special.
You're in Hong Kong.

411
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,620
And your hotel suite is not just a bedroom
and a bathroom, it has everything.

412
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,020
And look at the volume here.

413
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,940
I mean, a couple can easily stay here

414
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,740
and be comfortable and have their
clothes be able to sit down, watch TV.

415
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,540
Look at this curved glass
here that faces the backyard.

416
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,620
So you kind of interact with the grounds.

417
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,780
And then you come over here
to your full bathroom.

418
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:24,090
Off of the entry, we have the water
closet, door opens up to the backyard.

419
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,740
This is your vanity.

420
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,810
Marble slabs have these reeded details
that run all the way to the walls.

421
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,229
And then you walk this way
to your open walk-in shower.

422
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:39,660
So tasteful,
something about natural stone.

423
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,290
How it can transform a space

424
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,029
into something so elegant,
so timeless, really speaks to me.

425
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,380
You have a built-in bench here,
all these slabs, rainhead above.

426
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,810
Then look at this Gessi fixture here.

427
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,100
It's like your control
knobs for your shower.

428
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:57,980
- [Mikey] We'll see this in the
primary bedroom as well.

429
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,540
A slightly different take on it.

430
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,043
But I think these are really, really cool.

431
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:03,260
- [Enes] without a doubt.

432
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,500
And this is your walk in shower.

433
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,700
And to me, this guest suite
has the full experience.

434
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,220
You have a seating area,
office, bed set up, really nice bathroom,

435
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,186
and then you just open up this
door and go to the backyard.

436
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,657
What's so unique about this property is
the fact that we are on over two acres.

437
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,620
And with its unique topography,

438
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,629
you get so many different outdoor
sections within this property.

439
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,140
Now, we're currently
on the backside of the home.

440
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,700
You can see the architectural
lines and details.

441
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,700
Again, vertically installed reclaimed
siding, steel case doors and windows.

442
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,020
The guest suite that we just
toured is on the left hand side.

443
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,810
House looks very modern
and rustic at the same time.

444
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,220
That's what I love about it.

445
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,980
Now, French doors here open up
from the entry and formal living room.

446
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,780
Those are the French doors that we
have off of the family room.

447
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,020
Again, it's all connected to the outdoors.

448
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,180
There's a retaining wall
on my right hand side.

449
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,620
And you can also see these mature trees.

450
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,871
Lush landscape.

451
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,810
Property is so private.

452
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,180
Then we have these steps taking us

453
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:16,090
to the side of the home where we have
an outdoor dining area, bar, seating area.

454
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,220
You got to appreciate
the olive trees as well.

455
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,860
That's what I really like about it.

456
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,740
And this dining area is so grand.

457
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,986
We have this solid wood table seating for,
I want to say, 15 plus.

458
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,000
And we have never seen these
kind of outdoor lights before.

459
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,957
They literally cantilever over the table.

460
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,260
So modern, at night.

461
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,686
This looks super cool as well.

462
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,557
- [Mikey] Yeah.
It's very like dreamy, you know.

463
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:43,271
- [Enes] Very dreamy. Well said, Mikey.

464
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,780
Now you have your outdoor grill there.

465
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,220
Outdoor seating area with a fireplace.

466
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,540
And look how private it is.

467
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,330
I'm just going to use this
way here for a second.

468
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,810
Go between these trees, this is your
side yard, not even your backyard.

469
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,050
And this section,

470
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,957
we have French doors opening up
from the family room and the kitchen.

471
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,614
Another important detail I want
to mention, there's a secondary driveway

472
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:08,330
right there that comes
up all the way here.

473
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,660
Perfect for caters.

474
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,980
Additional parking for the staff
that's going to maintain this home.

475
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,286
They can literally bring
their car up here.

476
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,371
Now, let's wrap around
to the front section of this property.

477
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,220
Outdoor seating area with a fire
pit right in the center.

478
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,357
There's a lower outdoor
seating area there.

479
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,980
And look at the views.
Look at the grounds.

480
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,290
I'm getting so excited.

481
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,940
Look at this grand staircase.

482
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,980
That brings you to the entry
and to this point.

483
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,980
And that's your front lawn area
with this contemporary pool.

484
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,871
Let's go down there.

485
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,286
This pool looks very inviting.

486
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:52,429
60ft long, 20ft wide,
dark plaster, Baja shelves.

487
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,625
And look how amazing this space is.

488
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,550
Grass lawn, outdoor seating
area on the other side.

489
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,020
This space really gives
me a Hampton's vibe.

490
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,570
You have your long pool.

491
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,290
Your estate is on the back.

492
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,330
It's private, it's lush,

493
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,500
and all you want to do is just
walk around and take it all in.

494
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,460
- [Mikey] Yeah, it looks really cool.

495
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,700
And this starts to give you an idea
of the topography of the land.

496
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,472
A little bit better.

497
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:16,900
- [Enes] Yeah, we're still
within the property.

498
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,220
Yeah, how we have these elevation
changes right there.

499
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,140
We just have the stairs that we
were on top of around the corner.

500
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,810
We have the side yard and barbecue
area that we just toured.

501
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,980
And there's even more down below us,
which we will see in a second.

502
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,050
- [Enes] Absolutely.
To me, house is gorgeous,

503
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,540
but having grounds like this is
what takes it to another level.

504
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,140
You can easily have two
to three hundred people here

505
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,330
hanging out for an event, and you can
accomplish that with this property.

506
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,000
Now, this is the main staircase going up

507
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,940
to the entry, and now
we're at the motor court.

508
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,260
This is the front facing balcony,
three car garages below.

509
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,660
You can easily park 20 to 30 cars
here just on this space alone.

510
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,570
And if this is not enough for you,

511
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,740
down below us, we have a ten car garage
that matches the architectural lines

512
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,500
of this home, and it also
has a spacious driveway.

513
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,700
So in total, I want to say you can park 40

514
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,090
to 50 cars on this compound,
which is incredible.

515
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,740
It's not something that you find on every
single property in Beverly Hills.

516
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,660
Land is really valuable here.

517
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,330
And not only you get the privacy,
you get the grounds,

518
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,260
you also get the space that you can really
use for your cars or for your events.

519
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,840
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's insane.
And I got to say, this frame I'm looking

520
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,420
at on my camera right now
looks absolutely crazy.

521
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,114
The house is just towering above you.

522
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,810
- [Enes] The development
of an incredible property

523
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,957
like this doesn't happen without the all
important component of financing.

524
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:42,000
So we sat down with
Max's business partner Emil,

525
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,514
to learn just a
little bit about their process.

526
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,620
Emil, thank you so much for joining us.

527
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,330
You are Max's business
partner on this project.

528
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,020
How do you help someone like Max
to balance between financing, designing,

529
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,020
staying in a timely manner,
and keeping investors happy?

530
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,200
- [Emil] Typically, you buy the land,
you engineer it, and you figure out what

531
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,620
you're going to build, and then
you start the design process.

532
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,260
With Max, he does the opposite.

533
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,050
When we're in escrow,
he's designing the project.

534
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,700
By the time we close the deal,
it's rendered.

535
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,243
So you already know what it's going
to look like, how it's going to feel like.

536
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,620
- [Enes] What you're getting into.
- [Emil] Exactly.

537
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,180
Max and I put in significant amount
of capital of our own into the deal.

538
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,570
Besides that, we go out
there and raise money.

539
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,660
Right.
How do we do that?

540
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,780
Well, by having a track record of success.

541
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,860
You have to put in some
of your own skin in the game.

542
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,260
I mean, look, people want to be
a part of a cool project.

543
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,290
The best thing about kind of at the level

544
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,540
that we're at now, everybody likes
each other, people are having fun.

545
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,680
You create this product.
Yeah.

546
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,940
You're working your butt off
to try to make it happen.

547
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,180
And it's 14 hours, days,

548
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,090
and Max is here looking at every crevice,
every single thing, doing touch ups,

549
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,810
et cetera, making sure it's a product
that he wants to be proud of.

550
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,014
For him, it's extremely personal.
- [Enes] Very personal.

551
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:50,700
- [Emil] Very personal.

552
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,214
And so, I mean, it's a joy to see
that on the site, at least for me.

553
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:54,780
Right.

554
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,660
And I love it when my partners
are all hands on deck.

555
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,260
I'm very passionate about what I do.

556
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,700
He's passionate about what he does.

557
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,810
And that chemistry,
that energy is what people see.

558
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,140
The investors know that, right?

559
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,330
They get their reports, they're excited,

560
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,557
they tour the property like,
we did this together.

561
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,420
That formal living room right there.

562
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,900
Look at that glass assembly.

563
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,660
That's a front facing balcony.

564
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,780
Again, down below, we have a three
car garage, exterior door.

565
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,140
And this is the guest suite
that we toured on the main level.

566
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,957
You can actually see
the balcony from here.

567
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,500
Now we're going to take
an interesting route.

568
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,168
I want to open up this French door here,

569
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,180
so we could go in to the lower
level guest suite.

570
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,460
What I like about this space is the fact
that it has its own exterior access.

571
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,260
Guest suite is very spacious.

572
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,050
King size bed right in the center.

573
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,980
Small seating area, closet space.

574
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,140
And the color palette.

575
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,540
And the design palette used in this room

576
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,660
is on the lighter side
with these terrazzo tiles.

577
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,500
Mikey, let's quickly show it.

578
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,090
We have a full bathroom here that carries

579
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,380
out the same terrazzo elements all
the way into the walk in shower.

580
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,620
This modern pedestal sink

581
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,180
with incorporated top, brush
nickel fixtures, and going back out,

582
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,886
of course, we have a full walk-in closet
here, Rimadesio cabinetry.

583
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,300
Overall really nice guest suite.

584
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,220
And again, I really like
these lighter tones.

585
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,810
Now, coming here, this is the secondary
staircase landing, storage closets.

586
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,810
This door right here opens
up to the laundry room.

587
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,420
All stainless steel cabinetry,
commercial grade.

588
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:36,090
And then we have this door opening up to
the three car garage that we saw earlier.

589
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,940
Same terrazzo floors are here.

590
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,086
Again, stainless steel
built-ins and open shelving.

591
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,700
And on the other side,
we have the staircase landing.

592
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,860
For the main staircase,
we have a small built-in area here.

593
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,900
Open shelves above,
refrigerator down below.

594
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,540
And going this way,
we have the screening room.

595
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,380
I really like this couch.

596
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,740
Massive TV on the other side,
black plaster throughout.

597
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,260
And on the walls, they have
this rock wall feature.

598
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,860
With LED lights to create contrast
and give depth to this room.

599
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,260
Looks super cool.

600
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,620
Then we go over here.

601
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,330
Game table, another pattern wall.

602
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,940
That's walnut, floor lights.

603
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,180
And we have two built-in seating
areas with skylights above.

604
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,640
I hope I mentioned it when we were

605
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,090
at the backyard, but you can actually
see those skylights from there.

606
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,380
And some bookshelves.

607
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:34,740
It's just a cozy area for you to just sit
down, relax, and enjoy the lower level.

608
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,380
With that, we're done here.

609
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,857
Now let's go to the second floor so
we can check out the bedroom suites.

610
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,140
Now, off of this staircase landing,
we have three guest suites.

611
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,700
This staircase here takes you up

612
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,700
to a really unique space that we're
going to check out in a bit.

613
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,050
But first, I want to take everybody here

614
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,900
so we can see the first guest
suite that faces the front.

615
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:02,020
Steel case, french doors open up
to a private balcony for this room.

616
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,900
Then we have a queen size bed here,
wall paneling on the back.

617
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,570
I really like this light
fixture right here.

618
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,860
Spacious room, built
in Rimadesio closets.

619
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,242
And of course, right here

620
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:15,529
we have a beautiful full bathroom,

621
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,330
with a glazed tile walk
in shower and a floating vanity.

622
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,780
Now I want to take everybody
back to the landing.

623
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,420
On the other side,
we have two guest suites.

624
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,020
First one starts here.

625
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,140
Queen size bed here,
oak paneling on the back.

626
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,290
Great volume with two skylights.

627
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,900
Then we have French doors here
opening up to a back facing balcony.

628
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,460
And this balcony is shared
by the bedroom next door as well.

629
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,330
And around the corner,
we have the full bathroom.

630
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,240
Now, I really want to take my time
to cover the details here because this is

631
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:50,220
one of the chicest bathrooms we
toured over the last few months.

632
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:53,260
I love this pastel pink tile selection

633
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,980
that starts on the floors and runs
all the way to the walls.

634
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,290
You can actually see these oversized

635
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,330
subway tiles installed
in a vertical pattern.

636
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,271
And in between, they have these
thicker pieces to create some depth.

637
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,660
Beautiful brush nickel fixtures,
freestanding tub right in the center.

638
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,900
And if you look above,

639
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,020
you can actually see the rainhead
because this is also your shower.

640
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,330
I love this bathroom.

641
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,540
I love the color palette here.

642
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,660
This is just so chic and retro.

643
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,290
- [Mikey] Yeah,
I really like this as well.

644
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,940
I feel like,

645
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,050
it is not clashing with the house,
but it is different enough to stand out.

646
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,090
- [Enes] Without a doubt,
it's definitely different.

647
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,780
It picks those pink elements
that we saw so far.

648
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:42,980
Remember the walkway, front lawn area,
main staircase house has this slight

649
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,900
midcentury influence,
I almost want to say.

650
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,500
And to me, this is just
a fun take on the bathroom.

651
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,780
And it looks absolutely gorgeous.

652
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,570
Now, on the other side, we have a floating
vanity with a cabinet on the bottom.

653
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,500
Generous countertop space, built-in sink.

654
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,540
Again, brush nickel fixtures.

655
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,740
Just a beautiful bathroom.

656
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,940
Now, this is not it for this guest suite

657
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,820
because right above us,
we have an amazing loft.

658
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,860
This is an extremely unique space.

659
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,939
You can use it as an office
or a seating area.

660
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,939
Two skylights bring great
natural light to this level.

661
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,819
And on my right hand side,
we have a small seating area.

662
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,690
Coffee table, storage closet.

663
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,939
This is a fun space.

664
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,539
And, Mikey, follow me this way.

665
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,940
We also have a built-in bookshelf here.

666
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,783
Well, this bookshelf also works,

667
00:34:31,257 --> 00:34:34,740
as a secret door
that leads you to the second

668
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,940
part of the loft, where
we have a small office.

669
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,609
- [Mikey] You know,
I love secret doors.

670
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,539
How cool is this.

671
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,650
This is really cool.
I like this.

672
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,819
- [Enes] This is fantastic.
And follow me this way.

673
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,020
This is the door and the small walkway
that takes you back to the landing.

674
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,740
So from the loft, you can actually
go down to the staircase landing.

675
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,650
I really like this little loft area.

676
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,779
This is incredible.

677
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,100
And again, small office setup, two chairs.

678
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,543
And down below us,
we have the third guest suite.

679
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,690
Just like the bedroom next door.

680
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,100
It's very spacious.

681
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,680
Hardwood floors, queen size bed here,
wood paneled back wall.

682
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:13,743
French doors open up to
an amazing balcony, beautiful views.

683
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,690
And above us is the loft,
which looks super cool from this angle.

684
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,820
You have your TV, you have your
walk-in closet behind this door.

685
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,650
And around the corner,
we have the full bathroom.

686
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,130
Now, I really like the
terrazzo approach here.

687
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:30,260
With the floor tiles
and the wall tiles.

688
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,540
And if you look closely,

689
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,600
you can see that floor tiles are a little
bit more polished,

690
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,170
has that polished look.

691
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,514
Wall tiles are more flat
and a little bit textured,

692
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:42,300
so there's a nice
subtle contrast there.

693
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:47,540
Then your shower is all open with a glass
wall, beautiful brush nickel fixtures.

694
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,690
You have your floating vanity on the other
side, another gorgeous bathroom.

695
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,170
Now let's jump back to the landing again

696
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,620
so we can continue our tour
of the rest of this home.

697
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,714
Now, coming to this point,

698
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:06,170
we get this amazing view of the main floor
as well as the second floor walkway

699
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,130
that takes you all the way
to the primary bedroom suite.

700
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,210
This vaulted roof line here,
exposed steel beams with LED lighting,

701
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,130
wood clad ceilings, light fixtures,
these massive steel cased doors

702
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,620
and windows bringing so much
natural light to the space.

703
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,650
And all of these qualities coming together

704
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,580
makes this walkway
bridge and this moment really special.

705
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,620
You get to call this place your home,
and it's fantastic.

706
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,690
Then you have art pieces creating

707
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,043
beautiful contrast around the property
against these dark plaster walls.

708
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:44,957
I'm speechless.

709
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,420
- [Mikey] Actually.
At a loss for what to say.

710
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,300
This is a really awesome space,
and we actually get a really good view

711
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,980
of the front door from here
and how big it is.

712
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,060
- [Enes] It's massive.

713
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,130
And then you have your main staircase

714
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,340
curving beautifully and bringing
you to the second level as well.

715
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,210
And right here is the massive pivot door

716
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,170
that opens up to your
primary bedroom suite.

717
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,885
Come on in.

718
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:12,500
Now, this walkway takes us to the bedroom.

719
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,980
But before we go there,
I want to go right here so we can start

720
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,042
our tour with the first walk in closet.

721
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:23,780
Rimadesio, built-in cabinetry
with glass doors and sleek handles.

722
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,100
Look so beautiful.

723
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,460
Then we have an island right
in the center with a glass top.

724
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,620
And within the built-in cabinetry,
we also have LED lighting.

725
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,780
I mean, this looks like
an exquisite boutique.

726
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,340
We have great volume here.

727
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,100
Two windows bring in natural light.

728
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,540
And you can go to the bedroom side,
either through this walkway right here,

729
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,100
which also has two doors opening
up to a private balcony.

730
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,780
Or you can take this side
and go to your bedroom.

731
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,986
Follow me this way.

732
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,300
This space is phenomenal.

733
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,340
The volume, king size bed,

734
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,953
seating area by the fireplace,
black plaster wall, built-ins,

735
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,060
steel case french doors opening up
to the front balcony.

736
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,980
I can easily do a ten minute walkthrough of this bedroom alone.

737
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,460
And I really mean that.

738
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,300
When you start looking into details

739
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,314
and how this room was curated,
it really impresses you.

740
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,540
I mean, look at this bed.

741
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,130
This has to be one of the most beautiful
beds we have ever seen on our channel.

742
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,357
I know you like low profile beds,
but something about this headboard.

743
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,029
And how it's upholstered.

744
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,940
Color selection and the
minimalist approach here is chef's kiss.

745
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,671
I love it.

746
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:38,671
- [Mikey] I know Max, is a fantastic designer of homes but, the fact that he curates all the furniture to place in the space as well really makes it kind of unique and special.

747
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:41,453


748
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,291


749
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:46,060


750
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,900
- [Enes] He obsesses over them.

751
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,100
And when you look around, come with me.

752
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,540
Let me show you this detail.

753
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:57,340
So we have this built-in switch plate
here with a plug, with a USB-C outlet.

754
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,650
- [Mikey] Let me get close here.

755
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,820
- [Enes] And it also
has this reading light.

756
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,860
And look how incredible this detail is.

757
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,940
This wasn't just randomly chosen, right?

758
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,690
A lot of times on the homes that we tour,

759
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,900
it will be a nice, elegant
light switch or like a cover plate.

760
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,500
And you look at the back wall
and it has this beautiful texture.

761
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,580
It's vein match runs all
the way to the ceiling.

762
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,743
And then you can see
the exposed roof rafters

763
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:27,170
with LED lighting, wood clad
ceilings to really warm up the space.

764
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,900
And on the other side, you have
a cozy, intimate seating area.

765
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,540
Fireplace with a brass around,
beautiful marble wall on top.

766
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,071
And next to the fireplace is
this built-in section here.

767
00:39:41,186 --> 00:39:45,780
LED lit, open shelves
and more Bearbricks.

768
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,690
To me, I'm really fascinated by all these

769
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,650
accessories, finishes, materials coming
together to curate a space like this.

770
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,971
And that's what makes it so unique.

771
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,741
Why having these homes,

772
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:04,780
so finished to perfection
is that important to you?

773
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,871
That's what I want to know.

774
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:07,986
- [Max] Bringing all these materials

775
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:10,814
and finishes and the
furniture pieces in harmony

776
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:17,100
is just an amazing feeling that I
have in the end of each project.

777
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:22,671
And having the furniture pieces
is very important to me.

778
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,529
But I just want them to enjoy the product

779
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:29,457
as it is in the full scope.

780
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,940
- [Enes] Now,
we have this opening leading us

781
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,460
to an intimate seating area
for the primary bedroom.

782
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,780
Beautiful couch.

783
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,500
All these windows bring
in so much natural light.

784
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,020
French doors opening up
to a private balcony.

785
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,786
And above us, we have this unique ceiling

786
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:48,914
design with turnbuckles,
modern chandelier,

787
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:53,460
TV on this side, amazing views,
more Bearbricks.

788
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,500
And before we leave behind Mikey,

789
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,886
we have a gorgeous wet bar fabricated
out of marble with open shelves.

790
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,420
Now let's take everybody back

791
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,743
to the primary bedroom one
more time to take it all in.

792
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,820
Phenomenal space.

793
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,740
We have the primary bathroom on this side,

794
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,686
which we're going to check
out just in a second.

795
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:16,786
But now I want to open up this French door
here so we can check out the balcony.

796
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,380
We are part of this beautiful
canyon in Beverly Hills.

797
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,100
It's lush, it's green, it's relaxing.

798
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,940
You can look down to your grounds.

799
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,020
Look how amazing that pool looks.

800
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,940
We talked about the outdoor
seating areas here earlier.

801
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,130
It's fantastic.

802
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,740
- [Mikey] This is what I love about
the canyons of Los Angeles.

803
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,980
Even though we're kind of in the heart

804
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,300
of the city, it feels like we could be
in any scenic location in the world.

805
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,170
It's so green and beautiful, and we're,

806
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,514
what, like, ten minutes
from the heart of Beverly Hills?

807
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:44,130
- [Enes] Correct.

808
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,580
You live in the city, but you get
to enjoy an environment like this.

809
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,720
This is your backdrop off
of your primary bedroom.

810
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,260
It's incredible.
Just amazing.

811
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:56,038
All right, let's go back into the bedroom
so we can go to the other side

812
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,060
and start our tour of the
primary bathroom, which is amazing.

813
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,914
Just as impressive as the bedroom.

814
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:02,643
Come on in.

815
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:06,380
First thing you recognize,
obviously, is the volume.

816
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:11,690
Again, LED lit, roof rafters,
wood clad ceilings, black plaster.

817
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,260
And right in the center,

818
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,690
we got this beautiful fabricated
vanity and makeup area combo.

819
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,980
And look at these drawers.

820
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,257
Look at these fronts,

821
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:23,857
how it's all vein match,

822
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,170
custom fabricated.

823
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,980
And again, I don't want people to
underestimate the word custom fabricated.

824
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,980
This was all designed by Nobel LA.

825
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,780
They had technical drawings.

826
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,386
They got all these pieces
fabricated in Europe,

827
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,650
brought it here, assembled
to make sure it looks perfect.

828
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,740
You have two sinks and can
we get a close up, Mikey?

829
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,860
I know we saw one on the lower level,
but even the drain covers are branded.

830
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,860
Yeah.
Nobel LA.

831
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,060
- [Mikey] I would love to
do a video where we go

832
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:57,020
to Max's studio and learn what the process
is like to design stuff like this.

833
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,900
That would be pretty cool.

834
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,580
- [Enes] It's intricate, super detailed, very painstaking.

835
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,860
Yeah. Let me give you a heads up.

836
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,420
Those are the qualities you're going to see.

837
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,780
You're going to realize how many pages.

838
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:11,020
Some of these drawings can be
a vanity as simple as this one.

839
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,300
Can be hundreds of pages between

840
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:18,686
the hardware drawers, stones,
slabs, cuts, heights.

841
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:21,471
- [Mikey] Before it even
goes to modeling software.

842
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:21,999
- [Enes] Exactly.

843
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,460
Then you have fixtures.
You have to incorporate plumbing lines,

844
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,690
and you want to make sure
it looks this minimalist.

845
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,170
And then you look on the back,
then you realize they have these vertical

846
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,690
mirror walls with LED lighting separating those two vanities.

847
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,580
Because, again, we have a makeup
area on the other side.

848
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,640
Now, before I talk more about this

849
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,460
assembly, I actually want
to pull everybody this side.

850
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,820
Antonio Lupi.

851
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,260
Free standing tub, resin base.

852
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,500
Gessi fixtures,
you have more of that copper tone.

853
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,100
Then you go behind this
glass partition wall.

854
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,860
You arrive to your walk in shower.

855
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,300
Impressive.

856
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,420
Built-in bench, marble floors.

857
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:08,460
These two freestanding shower heads
with handheld and shower head above.

858
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:12,660
Then you have your rainhead,
windows bring in natural lights.

859
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:15,980
And honestly, if I lived in this house,

860
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,060
I would pull all these blinds up
and just expose it to the outdoors.

861
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,820
Because this property is super private.

862
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,420
No one is going to see you up here.

863
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,429
You might as well enjoy your shower.
- [Mikey] This is one.

864
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,180
- [Enes] Enjoy the views.

865
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,860
- [Mikey] This is one of the coolest
showers I think we've ever seen.

866
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,980
Not only because of the design I really
like these shower heads and the rainhead,

867
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,780
but also just like the window
array you have in here.

868
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,180
You have, like, 180 degree
views of your backyard.

869
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,860
It's really cool.
- [Enes] Absolutely.

870
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,860
And these freestanding shower
heads are definitely unique.

871
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:45,395
Even the handhelds are just so exclusive.

872
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:50,080
- [Mikey] Yeah, and my favorite thing is
how they control everything right here.

873
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,920
I thought it was a stereo
when I first got in here.

874
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,314
It's really cool looking.

875
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,210
- [Enes] And this is the walk-in shower.

876
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,340
Mikey, stay right there.

877
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,060
Let me go to the other side.

878
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,340
You flow right back out
to the center of the bathroom.

879
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,420
You have your first water closet here.

880
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,755
Of course, Max would design

881
00:45:08,756 --> 00:45:10,366
a stone back wall,

882
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:15,569
for the toilet with LED lighting
just so even that looks elevated.

883
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,042
Yeah.

884
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:19,340
He could have just easily mounted
on the wall here, but instead,

885
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,300
you can flare it up like this,
Rimadesio built-in cabinets.

886
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,114
Mikey, can you pan up for a second?

887
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,943
Are you seeing those strips?

888
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:27,471
- [Mikey] Yeah.

889
00:45:27,472 --> 00:45:31,700
- [Enes] Those are LED lights
that face the ceiling.

890
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,620
They're mood lights.

891
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,060
- [Mikey] So, like, at night,
with all the lights off,

892
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,900
it just adds a little bit
of a little bit of light in here.

893
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,449
- [Enes] Exactly.

894
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,020
I'm sure I know you
like details like this.

895
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,580
The lighting in this house is something
else when it comes to mood lighting.

896
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,300
Backlighting every single fixture,
recessed in floor lights.

897
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:52,460
Throughout it's pretty impressive.

898
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,340
You have your second water closet.

899
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,260
And follow me this way, Mikey.

900
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,700
This is the makeup area.

901
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,580
Again, all fabricated out of marble.

902
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,780
They have this leather
inserted section here.

903
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,180
Rimadesio built-in cabinetry.

904
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,300
Another picture window
that faces the backyard.

905
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,980
This is without a doubt one of my favorite

906
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,940
homes we have ever
toured in Beverly Hills.

907
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,420
I'm really glad we got an opportunity
to tour it and share it with all of you.

908
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,400
And we've been also recognizing that a lot

909
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,700
of our viewers have been asking us to do
longer tours at night because they really

910
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:31,540
enjoy seeing these properties with all
the lights on, how they live at night.

911
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:35,314
And I can't think of a better
home to show you than this one.

912
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,140
- [Max] So for me, the evening scenario
of the lighting is very important because

913
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,820
evening is where you spend
every day in your house.

914
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,460
During the day, I usually work.

915
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:55,500
I cannot enjoy 01:00 p.m.,
sunshine at the pool.

916
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,340
That's why it's only the weekends.

917
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:00,380
But every day in the evening,

918
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:04,060
I'm in my house and I want
to enjoy different scenarios.

919
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,740
Ambient light.
I want everything in the soft lights

920
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:12,020
and the whole house become much warmer
when you turn on all the lights.

921
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:17,740
In the ambient scenario for the evening,
each beam and the ceiling has a lighting.

922
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:24,471
Every single item that you see
in design has here a separate lighting.

923
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,138
Now it's been a minute,

924
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:14,529
since we have done one of these tours,

925
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:17,210
walking the property at night.

926
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,380
This one is so special that we wanted

927
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,210
to take the time to run you
guys around one more time.

928
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,210
Welcome to the main level.

929
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,660
This is the family room.

930
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,800
Again, all that built-in lighting,

931
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,580
ceiling lights, track lights,
mood lights throughout.

932
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,829
Really play a huge role when it comes
to the feel of this home at night.

933
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,660
This is the kitchen.

934
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,800
Looks just as good at night, too.

935
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,580
And coming right here, formal dining area.

936
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,878
Chandeliers above with
windows all dark now.

937
00:48:49,078 --> 00:48:51,180
It's a little bit more intense.

938
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,660
And the importance of these recessed
in floor lighting, there you go.

939
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,060
It just creates a nice contrast.

940
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,340
And obviously, if you dim the lights here
and dim the chandelier,

941
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,820
it will amplify even more and you can
see more of the lightbox design here.

942
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,700
Another thing I want to point out.

943
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,629
Look at the lighting
within the light switches.

944
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:11,540
They really pop.

945
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,580
- [Mikey] Oh, yeah.

946
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:16,457
During the day, these are just
details we really can't see.

947
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,571
- [Enes] And welcome to the entry
and the formal living room.

948
00:49:21,686 --> 00:49:24,540
Has to be the most impressive space
within the property.

949
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,660
Volume here.

950
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,060
Exposed roof rafters.

951
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:32,620
Now you can really see how the lighting
within the beams play a huge role

952
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,357
in regards to softening
and warming up the space.

953
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:41,300
Then you have your modern light fixtures,
light box design behind the built-ins.

954
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,580
A lot to take in.

955
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,210
What a beautiful home.

956
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,140
And with that, we are done with our tour.

957
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:48,780
Hope you'll enjoy this video.

958
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,700
Big congrats to Max and his team

959
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,629
at Nobel LA for doing
a fantastic job with this house.

960
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,500
