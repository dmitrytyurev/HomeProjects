1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,270
- What's up everybody?

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,970
It's Enes here, welcome
to another episode.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,030
This week, we're in Calabasas, California,

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,210
and about to tour this
incredible newly constructed

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,630
contemporary home right behind me.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,370
We got incredible amenities
and some of the best views

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,060
we've ever seen on this channel.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,690
We have a beautiful infinity
edge pool, basketball court,

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,100
amazing grounds, and
over 22,000 square feet

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,530
of interior square footage.

11
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,310
So we've got a lot to see today,
make sure to stick around.

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,950
Now stats on the house.

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,610
We got eight bedrooms, 14 baths,

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,760
22,000 square feet of interior space,

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,420
built on a 1.75 acre lot

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,370
and this property is
currently on the market

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,690
for $37,999,000.

18
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,260
As always, we will leave more information

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,330
about the property down
in the description,

20
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,850
and before we start our tour,

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,150
I wanna thank the listing
agent, Tomer Fridman,

22
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,850
for allowing us to tour
his amazing listing.

23
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,220
Now let's begin.

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,803
(upbeat music)

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,050
On the exterior we have this white walkway

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,360
taking us up to the front entry.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,910
House is a French
contemporary architecture.

28
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,220
I love the smooth stucco
finish, steel casement windows

29
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,570
and all these copper
details like the gutters

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,900
and the flashings on the bottom.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,003
Now let's go inside.

32
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,323
Alright, everyone,

33
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:46,053
here we are at the entry,
beautiful glass pivot door.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,640
Now let's talk about this entry.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,100
We have two-story ceilings here,

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,880
with skylights bring in natural light in

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,160
right above me we have these chandeliers

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,050
and we're gonna take this direction first.

39
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,040
And this is where we have
the formal living room

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,700
and formal dining room area.

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,560
Let's start with the formal dining room.

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
Table for ten, three chandelier's above.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,450
We have built-ins on each side

44
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,900
and casement windows bringing
a lot of natural light in.

45
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,449
To this side of the home,

46
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,540
right in the center we have

47
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,260
this beautiful linear gas
fireplace clad with glass

48
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,143
and another seating area
right in front of it.

49
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,590
Ceiling wood panel ceilings are also here

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,900
and we have more additional seating areas

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,800
right in front of me.

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,330
Let's continue.

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,690
We have another feature wall on this side

54
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,700
with floating shelves,

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,020
and I love how they put LED lighting

56
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,530
right behind that as well.

57
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,290
And we're used to seeing
a lot of fireplaces

58
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,560
in formal living room areas,

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,560
this time we have a water
feature, which is really cool.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,600
And this one actually has another amenity

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,873
I'll show that in a bit.

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,900
We have another picture
window on this side,

63
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,730
and of course we have the Fleetwood doors

64
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,160
pocketing into the walls,

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
opening up to the backyard,
and then the cool detail,

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,060
every single one of the
Fleetwood doors on this house,

67
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,540
they're all automatic.

68
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,690
Additional seating area right here.

69
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,920
And this whole space is complimented

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,910
with this bar set up on this side.

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,530
Now I love how they
clad the bar with marble

72
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,920
on top, on the side and up front as well.

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,222
We have all the amenities here.

74
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,170
We get one of these
mini push wine fridges,

75
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,860
there you go, dual elevation.

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,560
We have more cabinets on this side.

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,320
I love the built-ins up top
with these glass shelves

78
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
with inlet lighting, which is really cool.

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,100
It looks really exquisite.

80
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,140
I think let's give it
a shot, there you go.

81
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,490
We have the dishwasher here

82
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,880
and this is where we have
the sink for this bar

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,600
another detail,

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,253
Mikey, let's focus towards
that water feature.

85
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,763
There you go.

86
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,120
In case you wanna watch some TV.

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,810
- [Mikey] Yeah, that's really cool.

88
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,110
- It's pretty cool, right?

89
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,470
And there you go.

90
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,720
When you want that sleek look can go raise

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,553
there you have it.

92
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:56,450
- [Mikey] Just put it back up.

93
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,730
- That's right, now,
let's continue our tour.

94
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,170
We take this hallway.

95
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,240
We're kind of back at the entry
at the end of this hallway,

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,780
we have the front door right there.

97
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,910
Let's talk about this incredible steel

98
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,963
staircase design right here.

99
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:12,390
We have the steel frame, open riser.

100
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,430
We have LED lighting
underneath each thread,

101
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,529
glass railing all around the
staircase is magnificent,

102
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,429
it's right in the center of the home.

103
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,500
Right across, we have the
elevator access for this level.

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,413
Now, continuing this way,

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,660
we have the breakfast nook right here

106
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,840
with this beautiful marble
table chandelier above.

107
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,790
We have the Fleetwood doors
already pocketed in opening up

108
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,660
to the outdoor patio.

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,270
We'll talk more on that later.

110
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,670
And as we continue, we have
more built-ins on this side.

111
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,690
Everything is super sleek,
I love the hardware.

112
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,410
Let's get a close up, check this out.

113
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,300
- [Mikey] Oh wow!

114
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
- And you even have the plug set up right here.

115
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,370
Everything looks super sleek.

116
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,360
- [Mikey] How light is that?

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,410
- Super light, I love the hardware.

118
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,560
Now let's talk about the family room.

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,680
Again, family room has
an open corner design

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,640
on that side, Fleetwood doors
opening up to the backyard.

121
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,200
We have the gas fireplace
set up here with the TV.

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,640
I really like these
textured walls as well.

123
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,130
And we have a comfortable
seating area here.

124
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,000
Of course right on the other side,

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,290
we have another set of Fleetwood doors

126
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,620
pocketing into the walls,

127
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,650
opening up to another patio space.

128
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,490
Right across we have the guest house,

129
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,960
we'll talk more on that later

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,190
but now let's focus on
this incredible kitchen.

131
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,780
I love how simple and
elegant this kitchen is,

132
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,950
everything is nicely paneled
in, the contrast is beautiful,

133
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,920
we have a massive Island
upfront, pendant lights above.

134
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,910
Let's start with the Island.

135
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,480
We have the bar seating upfront.

136
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,830
Right in the center we have open shelving,

137
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,760
that contrasts beautifully.

138
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
Countertops continue.

139
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,340
We have the waterfall edge on this side.

140
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,600
Pop-up plugs here.

141
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,350
Mikey let's wrap around for a second.

142
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,520
So we have the sink right here,

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,910
fabricated out of the same countertops,

144
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,070
and let's get a close
up right in the center.

145
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,870
First of all, they have
this beautiful cover plate

146
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,070
for drain stone and then yeah,

147
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,980
you can see all those cuts,

148
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,590
how they kind of created that slope.

149
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,060
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's really cool.

150
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,010
- Of course, let's start with this one.

151
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,870
There you go dishwasher number one,

152
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,250
we have another one on the other side.

153
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,003
I love how they're beautifully
paneled in looks seamless.

154
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,900
Also Mikey, can we get a
closeup on these cabinets?

155
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,960
They have the stainless steel
kind of edge reveal detail

156
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,340
that looks gorgeous in my opinion.

157
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,530
I love that detail.

158
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,780
- [Mikey] Yeah I feel like that kind of

159
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,613
is carried out through

160
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:31,800
a lot of areas of the house, yeah?

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,570
- Exactly, correct.

162
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,430
We have this panel refrigerate here.

163
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,940
It's a push of course, there you go.

164
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,083
This is the first one.

165
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,590
We have more built-ins right here.

166
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,500
Induction cooktop.

167
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,250
We have the vent above tuck nicely to the ceiling.

168
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,260
You get a little griddle.

169
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,870
Mikey let's get another closeup.

170
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,240
We get the cabinetry.

171
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,073
- [Mikey] Oh wow!

172
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:55,400
- [Enes] It's amazing isn't it?

173
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,030
- [Mikey] Yeah, that's a
fantastically well organized.

174
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,700
- Yeah, the hardware, all
these amenities, there you go.

175
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,570
I mean, it's incredible,

176
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,530
this is for sure the best
kitchen we've ever toured.

177
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,790
- [Mikey] I gotta show
that vent real quick,

178
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,280
I missed it when you
talked about it earlier.

179
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,150
- There you go.

180
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,060
- [Mikey] Yeah.

181
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,950
- And we have more open shelving detail.

182
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,230
It kinda breaks the flatness
of this cabinetry design.

183
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,880
Built-ins on this side.

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,713
You're ready?

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,124
- [Mikey] Oh wow!

186
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:21,957
(Enes chuckles)

187
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,030
- Isn't this pretty cool?

188
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,730
- [Mikey] Yeah, I think we
should make some lemonade.

189
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,300
- No this is Fridge staging.

190
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,490
- [Mikey] Yeah.

191
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,323
- I love it.

192
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,200
Overall, by the way,
these are glass panels.

193
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,540
Overall it's a very simple sleek design.

194
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,440
Of course we have another
set of pop-up plugs

195
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,640
on the other side.

196
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,170
Beautiful kitchen.

197
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,950
Kitchen is complimented with
this wine wall right here.

198
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,350
Of course it's temperature controlled.

199
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,043
Let's follow this whole
way continue our tour.

200
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,300
And there's the cool
little detail right there.

201
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,250
Coolest clock ever.

202
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,210
- [Mikey] Yeah we've been talking
about this almost all day.

203
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,370
This is like maybe my
favorite clock I've ever seen.

204
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,203
- I know.

205
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,036
- [Mikey] That's really cool.

206
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:57,869
- It is pretty cool.

207
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:59,720
Now I guess part of the kitchen

208
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,320
kind of continues on this side.

209
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,890
The other side of the wine wall.

210
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,610
We have another wine display here,

211
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,530
again, temperature controlled

212
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,330
and we have a small fridge on this side.

213
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,483
Let's get a close up some cabinetry here,

214
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,990
espresso maker, look at the backsplash

215
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,250
or like the back wall,

216
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,420
the glass with LED lighting
looks so cool, right?

217
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,440
- [Mikey] Yeah, that's really cool.

218
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,630
- And check this up.

219
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,150
This might be my favorite
detail in this house.

220
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,880
Look at these doors, coolest ever.

221
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,730
- [Mikey] Oh wow!

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,860
- Just like that.

223
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,930
- [Mikey] Yeah I think it'll probably

224
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,580
show better if you open it.

225
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,039
Let's do that one more time.

226
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,039
- Look how it falls then
seamlessly tucks into the wall.

227
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,080
- [Mikey] That's a really really nice.

228
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,020
- I mean it's gorgeous.

229
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,000
And we have another ice maker here,

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,550
small sink and actually
kitchen kind of continues

231
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,960
because right across

232
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,840
we have the catering kitchen come on in.

233
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,060
We beautiful upper cabinetry
sheet with glass panels

234
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,980
and all the base cabinetry,

235
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,910
all the built-ins are
beautifully paneled in

236
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,920
with stainless steel
finishes looks incredible.

237
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,243
- [Mikey] Yeah, and this is
my favorite room in the house.

238
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:08,760
There's something about
black and stainless together

239
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,570
that I just love, but it looks really like

240
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,620
the essence of minimalism in here.

241
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,570
- I hear you,

242
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,220
I'm pretty sure this is by
far the best caterers kitchen

243
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,440
we've ever toured on the channel.

244
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,273
- [Mikey] Yeah.

245
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:20,106
- For sure without a doubt.

246
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:21,060
So let's start here.

247
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,270
We have the stainless steel
countertops, I love this detail.

248
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,320
Mikey, let's get a close up.

249
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,430
They welded and fabricated
a sink in the continued

250
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,040
to countertop into a sink.

251
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,873
- [Mikey] So they weld that and then they blast that smooth, right?

252
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,410
and then they blast that smooth, right?

253
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,960
- Yep, isn't that cool?

254
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,793
- [Mikey] Yeah.

255
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,780
- Of course two dishwashers.

256
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,800
Nothing is compromised even though it's caters kitchen.

257
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,100
And as we continue, we have
the Meile gas stove here.

258
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,760
Commercial vent above cabinetry continues.

259
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,030
- [Mikey] Ah Nice warming drawer.

260
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,863
- That's right.

261
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:54,280
And on the other side we
have a built-in desk set up.

262
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,440
Mikey I got a question for you.

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,273
- [Mikey] Yeah.

264
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:58,540
- Why do you think we
have a desk over here?

265
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,940
- [Mikey] I can't imagine
it's easy to stay organized

266
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,890
when you're a chef cooking

267
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,020
for 10 or 12 people over
here in this little kitchen.

268
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,420
So a little desk to stay organized.

269
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,253
- Well you are correct.

270
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,630
I actually got a chance to talk

271
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,230
to the designer of this property

272
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,300
and mentioned to me that
he specifically wanted

273
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,290
to put this for the chef to
order the ingredients they need,

274
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,190
which is really cool, nice work area.

275
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,010
Now everything is beautifully paneled in

276
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,170
with stainless steel.

277
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,460
We have the freezer set up on this side

278
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,470
and other one right here.

279
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,337
Built-ins and right here,

280
00:10:26,337 --> 00:10:28,335
this is where we have the
fridge setup, there you go.

281
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:29,750
Let's get a close up.

282
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,930
- [Mikey] Fiji for days.

283
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,300
- I mean overall, what an
incredible caterers kitchen.

284
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,400
Now let's go back to the hallway.

285
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,570
We have the staircase going up
to the second floor and then

286
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,780
the closeup look at the
risers they placed in glass.

287
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,320
- [Mikey] Oh, nice, mirrored risers.

288
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,920
I don't know if we've ever seen it before.

289
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,753
- No, we never did.

290
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:50,600
It's a cool touch and I love
the LED lighting as well.

291
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,820
Right behind me, we have
this store opening up

292
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,470
to a bedroom on this level.

293
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,430
King-size bed, beautiful back panel walls.

294
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,430
I love the light fixtures
from the ceiling.

295
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,740
And right here, we have this
massive gas fireplace assembly

296
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,340
with a TV cloud beautifully
with this marble door opens up

297
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,230
to a walk-in closet and the bathroom,

298
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,960
wherever we have a floating
vanity textured walls

299
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
and a beautiful walking shower.

300
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,233
Now let's go back to the
hallway and continue our tour.

301
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,403
- [Mikey] While we're walking,

302
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,730
I just gotta say y'all on the other side

303
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,880
of the camera wont see
this or experience this,

304
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,956
but each of these rooms smells
absolutely incredible, yeah.

305
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:27,789
- Incredible...

306
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:28,622
- [Mikey] I don't kow what they use

307
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:29,650
but every room smells different.

308
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,900
- You get a little bit
of a hint right here.

309
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,250
- [Mikey] Yeah, it smells incredible.

310
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,220
- Yeah, the whole house smells incredible.

311
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,570
Now we're in the powder room.

312
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,710
We have a floating vanity
design glass countertops,

313
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,430
travertine walls around us.

314
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,010
And on that side we had the toilet.

315
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,900
As we go back to the hallway,

316
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,840
we're back at kind of like the entry area.

317
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,090
This is where we have the staircase

318
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,170
and we take this hallway.

319
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,180
We have two more rooms to see.

320
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,870
Wrapping around right on the other side

321
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,703
of that powder room,

322
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:57,900
we have an additional powder room.

323
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,470
We have more darker tones here.

324
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,910
Again, walls are clad with
stone floating vanity design.

325
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,740
Mikey, I don't know if you
can see it on the camera.

326
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,880
You see the color difference
between the countertop

327
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,710
and the sink itself?

328
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,750
- [Mikey] Yeah, I don't
know if you realize this,

329
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,407
but this is a mirror of the other bathroom

330
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:12,900
except it's black.

331
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,530
- Correct and it's on the other side.

332
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,363
- [Mikey] Yeah.

333
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:16,800
- And right here, let's show it.

334
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,510
This is where we have the toilet set up

335
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,147
with LED lighting on the walls.

336
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,021
- [Mikey] Just like the other side.

337
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:22,300
- Just like the other side, correct.

338
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,813
Now let's go back to
the hallway, last room.

339
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,330
Two pocket doors,

340
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,713
we have one on here,

341
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,860
one on the other side sealing
off the office, come on in.

342
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,930
We have two desks setups.

343
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,160
Beautiful built-ins on each side.

344
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,370
I guess let's show this side.

345
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,960
We have another one of these
sliding panels, there you go.

346
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,020
I love that you have the plugs as well.

347
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,750
This one is a front facing room.

348
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,700
We have the floating shelf design on the center and I know Mikey you're gonna think that I'm a nerd, but can we get a close up on the floors?


349
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,730


350
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,930


351
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,540


352
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,290
We have three floor plugs on this side,

353
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,540
two on the other side it's a nice detail.

354
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,330
So I wanted to mention
that overall great office

355
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,440
and that wraps our tour for this floor.

356
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,900
Now let's go back to the staircase

357
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,482
and check out the basement.

358
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,065
(upbeat music)

359
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,100
Alright, now let's talk
about this basement.

360
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,383
Let's start right here.

361
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,550
We have this hallway
and the door at the end

362
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,260
opens up to the 10 car
garage with epoxy floors.

363
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,960
We have a hallway storage right here

364
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,970
and this door, let's go inside.

365
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,950
This is where we have the laundry room.

366
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,830
Two washers, two dryers,
plenty of storage.

367
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,440
Now let's go back to the hallway

368
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,770
and we have another hallway
right here, two hallway closets

369
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,560
and the door at the end again
opens up to the 10 car garage.

370
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,420
Now let's go this way.

371
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,970
By the way this is where we
have the elevator access off

372
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,480
of the staircase.

373
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,970
And right here, we have this opening.

374
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,210
Let's actually briefly
go outside for a second.

375
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,190
We have this exterior hallway here,

376
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,560
which brings in a lot of natural light,

377
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,170
but at the same time, at the end,

378
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,680
you have the staircase
going up to your backyard,

379
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,910
which makes accessing to
the basement level easy,

380
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,990
and also on this side,

381
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,690
we have this texture stone
walls and on the bottom,

382
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,960
let's get a close-up.

383
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,793
We have the copper flashing.

384
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
- [Mikey] Yeah, and that's all
around the exterior, right?

385
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,010
- All around exactly gutters, everything.

386
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,510
Now, Fleetwood doors.

387
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,650
And we have another hallway
here, let's check it out.

388
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,570
I really liked the wood
tones throughout the house.

389
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,880
They clad all the walls here with wood.

390
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,080
And we have a electric
massage chair dry sauna.

391
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,350
Let's get a little tour.

392
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,013
We have the floating vanity
here, water closet on this side.

393
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,170
Mikey, let's pan up to
the ceiling for a second.

394
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,820
Are you seeing that rain head?

395
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,060
- [Mikey] Yeah, that looks,
it looks pretty unique.

396
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,350
- It's incredible, isn't it?

397
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,440
- [Mikey] There's like a design

398
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,910
to like the water spigots too.

399
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,743
I've never seen that.

400
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,770
- Yeah, there's for sure,

401
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,610
and this is your spa bathroom,
you have the marble walls,

402
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,690
Chrome fixtures, steam
shower, everything you need.

403
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,977
Now the other side, let's get a close up.

404
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,190
I know I didn't actually
need to go in there,

405
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,303
but this is where we have
the dry sauna there you go.

406
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,690
Fireplace, and you could
probably mount your TV here

407
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,523
if you need to.

408
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,650
- [Mikey] Yeah and I've never
actually seen a massage table

409
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,710
that's also a massager in itself you know.

410
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,670
- I think this is the first time

411
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,240
we are seeing something like
this, which is really cool.

412
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,300
We have the gym here nice and spacious.

413
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,060
We have the mirror wall on this side,

414
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,620
little bit of a bar area.

415
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,570
You get your fridge, your sink
set up, plenty of storage.

416
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,900
And at the end we actually
have set up Fleetwood doors

417
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,620
again pocketing into the wall,

418
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,510
opening up to the outdoor access,

419
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,520
that's where we have the staircase
going up to the backyard.

420
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,710
Now let's go back in.

421
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,860
We have more to see on
this basement level.

422
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,850
Now we're back at the landing
wood clad walls continue,

423
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,740
and this is where we have the wet bar,

424
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,100
I love the light tones
contrasting beautifully

425
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,690
with the black cabinetry.

426
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,770
Let's start with the Island.

427
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,860
We have the marble countertops.

428
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,500
It's book match with a waterfall edge.

429
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,190
We have the bar seating on this side.

430
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,470
Of course we have the
pop-up plugs right here.

431
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,230
Beautiful pendant lights above.

432
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,240
As we continue, we have
this beautiful back wall.

433
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,010
They use the same style of wood paneling

434
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,050
that we saw at the spa,

435
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,810
but they use that at a smaller scale

436
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,590
with the same color to give texture

437
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,540
to this bar setup right here.

438
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,820
Mikey, let's get a close
up on these bottoms.

439
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,550
I love how they clat even this
little section with Marble

440
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,383
which is really cool.

441
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:35,990
- [Mikey] Is that glass
on top of that as well?

442
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,200
- Exactly, these are glass shelves

443
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,900
but they have inlet LED lighting
inside, isn't that cool?

444
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,100
- [Mikey] Yeah, they look really unique.

445
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,030
- This bar is super sleek.

446
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,050
We have a wine fridge here
with one of these push doors,

447
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,050
there you go another fridge
on this side, nicely clad,

448
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,473
get a dishwasher.

449
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,350
I believe this is the
ice maker there you go.

450
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,450
We have the ice maker.

451
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,500
I love how they also recess
in this sink design right here

452
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,500
with a beautiful faucet. Overall
amazing bar, it's so sleek.

453
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,380
And we have a little bit of
a seating area right here,

454
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,010
personally, I love this
couch set up right here.

455
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,740
All right, let's continue.

456
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,609
Pocket doors, we have one right here,

457
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,869
we have another one on this side,

458
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,769
opening up to the movie theater,

459
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,030
come on in. Three tier seating.

460
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,440
We have the LED strip
lighting on the walls,

461
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,089
all they're nicely paneled.

462
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,969
And we have the screen on this side,

463
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,290
a bit of a more lounge and
kind of comfortable seating

464
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,740
on the lower level and right
above on the top two tiers,

465
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,910
we have these electric lounging
terrace made by Bugatti,

466
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,900
which is really cool,

467
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,550
and check this out the cup
holders you can heat and cool,

468
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,433
and there you go.

469
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,740
- [Mikey] Yeah, that looks
pretty comfortable there.

470
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,730
- It is pretty comfortable,

471
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,160
and this is this movie
theater is incredible.

472
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,740
It really is and I think it really matches

473
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,010
the rest of the house well.

474
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,850
So continuing our tour
right next to the bar,

475
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,700
we actually have a powder room.

476
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,380
Let's check it out real quick.

477
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,050
Floating glass vanity set up
with a textured back wall,

478
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,120
LED lit mirror, beautiful bathroom

479
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,610
- [Mikey] Yeah, and I love that contrast

480
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,640
between the white backlight
and the black wall.

481
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,010
- Agreed, agreed.

482
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,583
Moving on back to the hallway.

483
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,393
Now, as we continue this way,

484
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,550
we have the game room
right here and I must say,

485
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,220
this is probably the coolest
pool table we have ever seen.

486
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,850
We have a bit of a high
top seating over there,

487
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,160
chandelier's above TV on the side.

488
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,130
And right here, this door opens up to one of the bedrooms on this level, but egress access, walk-in closet, and a beautiful bathroom set up for the floating vanity and a walk-in shower.

489
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,830


490
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,730


491
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,090


492
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,350


493
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,640
Now this door opens up to the
second bedroom on this level

494
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,120
king-size bed situated on this side with a padded back wall.

495
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,400
We have a bit of a
seating area right here.

496
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,589
That's set up on this side,

497
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:52,020
set of windows bringing natural light in.

498
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,940
Right here, we have the full bathroom.

499
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,450
This one has a tub setup
with a textured walls

500
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,380
and they use the same
texture stone all the way

501
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,000
behind the floating
vanity design right here

502
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,610
and wrapping around.

503
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:06,560
This is where we have the
walk-in closet for this bedroom.

504
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,450
And that's pretty much it
for the basement levels.

505
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,120
Now let's take the stairs again,

506
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,399
go up to the second floor and
check out all the bedrooms.

507
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,982
(upbeat music)

508
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,933
Alright everyone,

509
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,840
here we are at the second floor,

510
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,360
we have two spacious guest suites

511
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,180
and the primary bedroom on this level.

512
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,730
Follow me.

513
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,060
We have this wide hallway skylights above

514
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,780
with panel ceilings continue.

515
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,740
I actually just realized a detail

516
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,870
Mikey, let's get a close
up on these skylights.

517
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,660
Are you seeing the LED strip lighting

518
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,990
all around the skylights?

519
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,740
I'm pretty sure they have
it at the whole house.

520
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,000
- [Mikey] Oh yeah, actually I
think I saw that at the entry.

521
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,330
What's that all about?

522
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,163
- I think they do that

523
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,160
so at night it still feels like a skylight

524
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,710
rather than just you know
have that dark glass.

525
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,420
- [Mikey] Yeah, well, I
mean, that looks really cool,

526
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,400
and I guess everyone will see
that here in a little bit.

527
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,370
- They're all gonna see
that in a bit, you're right.

528
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,340
All right, first of
all right here opens up

529
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,340
to the first guest
suite nice and spacious.

530
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,060
We have the skylight right in the center,

531
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,893
bringing natural light in.

532
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:11,920
Then this bedroom is front facing.

533
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,180
I love how cozy it feels.

534
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,130
We have the King size bed right here.

535
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,633
And the same ceiling reveal
detail is also in this bedroom.

536
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,150
This door opens up to the
walk-in closet, come on in.

537
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,440
We have the built-ins,
everything is nicely paneled.

538
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,510
We have the hangers,
drawers, everything you need.

539
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,740
Now let's go to the bathroom,

540
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,850
which is right here and
kind of the same finishes

541
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,090
that are also in this bathroom.

542
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,220
We have the textured stone back wall

543
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,710
floating vanity design.

544
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,730
I love these countertops and
how seamlessly, you know,

545
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,400
they transition into the sink
set up which is really cool.

546
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,330
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's almost
hard to even see on camera.

547
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,180
It's that seamless.

548
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,110
- Yeah, I agree.

549
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,310
And we have the full walk-in shower here.

550
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,980
Same stone has also
brought it into the shower.

551
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,330
Let's go to the second bedroom,

552
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,130
which is right next to this bedroom,

553
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,580
and it's right here.

554
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,900
This one, I have a feeling

555
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,090
this one is staged kind
of like a kid's room.

556
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,020
We have a little bit of a makeup area,

557
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,700
little bit more of the feminine tones,

558
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,470
again, another front facing bedroom.

559
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,303
Nice and spacious.

560
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:16,440
We had the bed situated on this side

561
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,443
with these ceiling mount light
fixtures, built-in closet.

562
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,880
Pretty much the replica of the
other bedroom, same finishes,

563
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,540
hangers, drawers, everything you need.

564
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,575
- [Mikey] Yeah and I got to say

565
00:21:27,575 --> 00:21:29,610
just like every other bedroom

566
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,443
in this house...

567
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:31,276
- I know what you're going to say.

568
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,109
- [Mikey] This one smells really good.

569
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:33,803
- Really good right, I agree.

570
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,540
And this is where we
have the shower set up,

571
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,150
walking shower, textures,
stone, back walls,

572
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,850
floating vanity, little bit of
a different countertops here

573
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,800
and a freestanding tub.

574
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,970
Let's go back to the hallway now.

575
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,233
And I want to briefly talk
about the staircase design.

576
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,760
Right at the end, this is the staircase

577
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,050
that we showed it to you
guys right after the kitchen.

578
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,883
And it comes up.

579
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:02,220
We have a massive picture window
bringing natural light in.

580
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,490
You see this railing design?

581
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,370
I thought it was really cool.

582
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,120
They kind of have this
like recess section.

583
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,250
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's really cool.

584
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,110
- It looks really modern

585
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,180
and they topped it off with
this marble right here.

586
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,890
- [Mikey] Once again, I bet
it looks really cool at night.

587
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,390
- I bet, I bet, now let's go to

588
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,230
the most important bedroom in
this house, primary bedroom,

589
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,140
first off, look at this pivot door.

590
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,900
It's insane and we have
this massive handle.

591
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,130
Come on in guys, we have the
pocket doors already opened up.

592
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,940
This primary bedroom is one of the best

593
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,340
we've ever seen on this channel,

594
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,050
and I really mean that because
of the amenities, finishes,

595
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,880
scale, views, everything.

596
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,330
This is the full package, right?

597
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,180
We have the best situated on this side.

598
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,940
I love how they went with
the wood-paneled look

599
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,640
on the back wall here as well.

600
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,630
Ceiling mount light fixtures.

601
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,770
Bed is perfectly situated for
the view and the backyard.

602
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,680
And we have that incredible
infinity edge pool

603
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
in the backyard.

604
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:53,500
We're also gonna see that in a bit.

605
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,660
Now we have the linear gas fireplace here,

606
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,020
clad beautifully with stone.

607
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,940
Everything is book
matched, TV on this side,

608
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,610
again, pocket doors
opening up to the balcony

609
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,380
and we have new bathrooms.

610
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,200
First one starts right here,

611
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,163
let's go in. Natural stone walls.

612
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,840
And right here, we have the first closet.

613
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,940
Nice and spacious.

614
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,250
Again, we have everything
you need LED lighting,

615
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,480
hangers, drawers, you
know, all the good stuff.

616
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,230
And this is where we
have the first bathroom.

617
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,950
So I want to talk about
this walk-in shower.

618
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,610
Let's go inside for a second
because this one is incredible.

619
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,210
First off stone everywhere,
skylights above.

620
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,530
We have Chrome fixtures
throughout your handheld.

621
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,700
I'm assuming this might be steam,

622
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,040
I actually don't know
exactly but it's a steam

623
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,460
or another shower head.

624
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,450
We have the head above and check this out.

625
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,600
You've got this section right here

626
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,120
with all these body sprays.

627
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,845
I've never seen anything like this,

628
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:52,678
it's supercool

629
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:54,000
- [Mikey] Yeah, this is, this is crazy.

630
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
- This is next level.

631
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,333
- [Mikey] Yeah.

632
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,180
- For sure.

633
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,460
Now we have another
Fleetwood door right here.

634
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,640
I mentioned it earlier
everything is automatic.

635
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,200
- [Mikey] We don't really
get to see that enough,

636
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,330
you know when I first moved to LA,

637
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,427
I was expecting like all these
houses we were gonna tour

638
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,730
were gonna be automatic doors.

639
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,900
- Not all of them have it.

640
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,910
You're right.

641
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,420
And there you go opens
up to your balcony setup.

642
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,690
We have another set of
floating vanity design,

643
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,380
fabricated countertops.

644
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,440
I have another detail

645
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,600
and I bet none of you
guys actually caught this.

646
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,330
I'm talking about my
videographers over here.

647
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,950
So we have a water closet here, right?

648
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,370
Mikey, go inside I'm gonna close the door.

649
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,482
- [Mikey] Okay, this is a first.

650
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,700
(both chuckling)

651
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,120
- And well, is that correct?

652
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,170
You miss it?

653
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,620
- [Mikey] This is for the financial guru,

654
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,360
you always got to check your ticker.

655
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,230
- That's right you always
got to check it right?

656
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,860
Let's close this door.

657
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,300
Let's go back to the bedroom.

658
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,783
Let's go towards the other
bathroom in the closet.

659
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,940
Actually, now that we
covered this section,

660
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,090
there's also this section, right?

661
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,770
Bit of a seating area, some
built-ins here, espresso maker.

662
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,210
We have the scene by folding door

663
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,920
also here, if you want to close this off,

664
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,070
which is really cool.

665
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,460
And we have a bit of a
desk set up on the side

666
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,860
and now going through this floor.

667
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,880
Now this is the real
closet check this out.

668
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,940
I mean, this looks like a exquisite store.

669
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,810
- [Mikey] It smells like one too.

670
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,930
- It smells like one too.

671
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,180
We have dual islands, drawers, shelving,

672
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,980
beautiful LED lighting.

673
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,860
These exquisite chandelier's
above, skylight,

674
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,720
I mean, we have everything you need.

675
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,980
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's incredible.

676
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,660
- This house is a showstopper for sure.

677
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,610
Now another set of pocket doors right here

678
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,400
going into the second bathroom.

679
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,610
Well, I guess let's start here.

680
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,090
We have the water closet
with a privacy glass,

681
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,383
right on the other side.

682
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,340
Massive walk-in shower,
beautiful Chrome fixtures,

683
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,500
rain head, recess
lights, marble everywhere

684
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,810
with the bench design

685
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,270
even LED lighting is also brought in here.

686
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:59,553
Now let's go back to the
bathroom, TV on this side.

687
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,270
Beautiful freestanding tub,
look at that tub filler.

688
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,660
Again, we never seen you
you fixtures, everything,

689
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,380
every detail in this house is so gorgeous.

690
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,620
- [Mikey] Can we turn this thing on?

691
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,279
- Let's give it a shot.

692
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,760
(water flowing)

693
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,600
- [Mikey] Yeah, that is really cool.

694
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,200
- That is really cool right?

695
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,830
And we have this massive
picture window perfectly focused

696
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,950
towards the view.

697
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,540
And this is where we
have the vanity setup.

698
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,200
Fabricated countertops with
hidden drain sinks,wall fixtures

699
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,620
Your mirror set up. An amazing bathroom.

700
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,480
Now I want to take you guys through here.

701
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,300
We have another set of Fleetwood doors

702
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,980
pocketing into the walls,

703
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,653
opening up to the balcony
for the primary bedroom.

704
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,170
We have space heaters here,
a bit of a sitting area,

705
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,340
incredible views.

706
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,260
And by the way, you get
the incredible views

707
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,870
and the privacy straight from
your bed, which is amazing.

708
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,600
And we have more additional
outdoor space right here.

709
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,030
This section is not covered,

710
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,220
but we get a fire pit right in the center,

711
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,780
beautiful wood decking,

712
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,870
and actually we can see some
of the finishes of the house

713
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,550
from here, smooth stucco,

714
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,820
copper gutters and your slate roof.

715
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,160
Overall, this is an
incredible bedroom suite.

716
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,500
The closets, the
bathrooms, the scale, views

717
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,700
are unbelievable but I think
this balcony, the view,

718
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,660
the setting and this incredible
backyard really tops it off.

719
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,380
Now, why don't we go downstairs

720
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,400
and check out the grounds

721
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,366
and this incredible infinity edge pool.

722
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,949
(upbeat music)

723
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,640
Alright everyone, we are
back in the first floor.

724
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,010
This is where we have the kitchen.

725
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,340
Of course, Fleetwood with
doors pocketing into the walls

726
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,320
opening up the side of the patio.

727
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,440
We wanna start from this side

728
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,340
because this is one edge of the property,

729
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
and we're gonna work our way

730
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,900
to that incredible infinity edge pool.

731
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,730
Right in front of me
we have the guest house

732
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,670
before we do that right
next to the guest house,

733
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,570
we have a putting green, how cool is this?

734
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,760
- [Mikey] Yeah, we don't really
get to see this that often,

735
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,070
but it's a nice little amenity to have.

736
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,460
- I don't know if it's little Mikey

737
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,840
it's a pretty good size putting green.

738
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,060
- [Mikey] Typically the ones that we see

739
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,120
are about a third of the size maybe.

740
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,460
- I agree, I agree.

741
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,750
Now let's go toward our guest
house which is right here,

742
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,160
we already have the
pocket doors opened up,

743
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,760
it has a nice corner glass detail.

744
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,410
And this is where we have the fireplace,

745
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,980
a bit of a seating area.

746
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,040
And it's a full guest house.

747
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,750
I mean, it has a dining
area, very sleek kitchen,

748
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,530
you have paneled in fridge, induction,

749
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,800
plenty of uppers even have built-ins

750
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,633
not to mention Mikey,

751
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,360
I need you to get a close up right here.

752
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,680
Look how gorgeous this kitchen sink is.

753
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,500
Now let's go inside.

754
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,010
This is where we have the bedroom.

755
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,500
Again, very spacious.

756
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,800
You get a bit of a desk
set up on this side,

757
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
TV, king-size bed.

758
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,180
And right here, this door
opens up to the bathroom

759
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,530
and the walk-in closet.

760
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,070
Again, textured stone walls are also here

761
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,620
with a casement window on top

762
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,740
for ventilation floating vanity,

763
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,700
beautiful bathroom and closet.

764
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,903
Now let's go back out.

765
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,520
We've been walking for
a while in this house.

766
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,670
Lots to see, right?

767
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,170
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's
been a long walking day.

768
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,440
- I agree, now let's talk about
the house for a little bit.

769
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,530
We have the kitchen right here opening up

770
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,440
and patio kind of extends out.

771
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,930
This is where we have the family room.

772
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,170
I mentioned it earlier,

773
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,230
has a nice corner glass
design here as well.

774
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,110
And right here,

775
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,640
we get this covered section
outdoor TV, fire pit.

776
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,360
That's where we have the breakfast nook.

777
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,790
You get an outdoor dining
area, beautiful space.

778
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,950
And with these pocket doors,

779
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,430
we get this amazing flow.

780
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,940
- [Mikey] Yeah, and what about
that sound we're hearing?.

781
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,870
- Yeah, this is another
special feature of this home.

782
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,350
So we have this massive retaining wall,

783
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,370
and they turned it into
this amazing water feature

784
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,710
that brings a lot of tranquility, peace

785
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,100
and amazing sound to this backyard.

786
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,330
- [Mikey] Yeah, sounds
like there's a river

787
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,520
running back here.

788
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,470
- Mikey, just look at it.

789
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,190
Look at the flat grass
section we have right here.

790
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,410
We have the water feature,
we get the privacy,

791
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,720
we get amazing views from the pool area,

792
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,810
amazing this property.

793
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,690
- [Mikey] We haven't even
gotten to the pool yet.

794
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,380
- That's like the best part
of this home in my opinion.

795
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,660
Now, as we continue right here,

796
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,340
we have another set of Fleetwood doors.

797
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,030
That's why we had the entry.

798
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,713
And as we continue to walkway,

799
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,180
this is where we have the
formal living room area

800
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,140
and walkway takes us to
the side of the property.

801
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,840
This is the other end
where we have a half court,

802
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,723
basketball court.

803
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,200
- [Mikey] Yeah, this is something
else, this is different.

804
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,033
- Something else.

805
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,070
- [Mikey] This hits different with me.

806
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,190
- I know, I feel you.

807
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,490
I mean, we literally have
everything in this house.

808
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,380
Views, privacy, incredible
interior square footage.

809
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,880
By the way, we have a little
gate right there opening up

810
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,370
in case you need to park
some cars over here,

811
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,460
you can do that as well.

812
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,960
- [Mikey] Yeah, not a basketball fan,

813
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,450
park your cars here instead.

814
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,450
- You can do whatever you like, right?

815
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,300
We have the retaining
walls on the other side

816
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,830
landscaped beautifully,

817
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,590
giving a lot of privacy to this property.

818
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,790
And this is the staircase
access to the basement level.

819
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,702
Pretty cool.

820
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:06,535
- [Mikey] Yeah.

821
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:10,130
- Now let's take this
hallway now let's continue.

822
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,320
And we have a really cool
outdoor seating area at the end.

823
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,370
Let's check that out.

824
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,840
I can't wait to talk about
this pool by the way.

825
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,140
It's incredible.

826
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,640
Now we have this outdoor
seating area, fire pit,

827
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,540
right in the center.

828
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,070
They formed this out of concrete.

829
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,000
So you get that little bit
of that industrial look.

830
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,800
Same thing the bench design is
also formed out of concrete.

831
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,370
We have a beautiful seating area here,

832
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,580
complimented with an 85 inch outdoor TV.

833
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,950
And I mean, the views
from here are incredible,

834
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,210
but we're gonna get a closer
look from the pool area.

835
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,060
So let's go back.

836
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,500
Now, this pool, the size is incredible

837
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,170
also it's above ground

838
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,220
and you have an infinity edge all around.

839
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:58,430
We have the bar shelves right here,

840
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,590
spa in the center and
it is focused perfectly

841
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,220
towards the view.

842
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,330
Of course the pool
comes to the pool house.

843
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,300
First door, we get a full bathroom here.

844
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,730
Let's check it out.

845
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,770
- [Mikey] Nicest bathroom I've
ever seen in a pool house.

846
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,790
- I know right?

847
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,030
Floating vanity, beautiful marble walls,

848
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,410
marble walk-in shower.

849
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,920
Even here you get a rain head.

850
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,753
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's great.

851
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:20,610
- It doesn't get much better right?

852
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,443
- [Mikey] Yeah.

853
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:25,190
- Now, let's continue
touring the pool house.

854
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,590
We have the same wood clad also here.

855
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,670
Your pool house has an amazing bar.

856
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,920
I mean it's amazing clad
with marble, dual elevation.

857
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,360
You get a dishwasher sink.

858
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,000
On the other side, you have
your ice maker, small fridge,

859
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,810
you get your TV, recessed and
LED lighting space heaters.

860
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,490
You got every amenity possible,

861
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,470
not to mention you get
another covered seating area

862
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,260
on this side with a fire pit,

863
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,490
all focused perfectly towards the view.

864
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,140
You may think where's the
barbecue set up, follow me.

865
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,620
It is right here, right
behind the pool house.

866
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,070
We get the full gas, barbecue
sink, everything you need.

867
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,433
Now let's go walk to the edge
of the pool, it's incredible.

868
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,700
So this pool is quite ambitious,

869
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,070
both on size and how it's
been planned and designed.

870
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:18,270
But I tell you something
it's worth every penny,

871
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,130
because it compliments this house so well,

872
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,700
you know it kind of has a timeless look,

873
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,680
but yet it's very contemporary.

874
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,620
We have these incredible peaceful views.

875
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,920
I've never seen any view
like this before, ever.

876
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,120
It's so peaceful, we have
the Santa Monica mountains.

877
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,280
This is something to experience.

878
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,700
- [Mikey] Yeah and this is a neighborhood

879
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,570
we're kind of new to.

880
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,130
We spent a little time in Calabasas,

881
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,650
but I'd love to spend more time
out here, go for on a hike.

882
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,540
Looking down, there's
hiking trails all below us

883
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,480
and it's just really unique.

884
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,220
- I agree and something about this house,

885
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,020
like we taught a lot of
high price point homes

886
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,280
and we get the pricing,

887
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,620
and write the location, the finishes,

888
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,410
but this one, when you tour the home,

889
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,600
you look at the location,
the setting, the grounds,

890
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,040
and you look at this view, it makes sense.

891
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,640
The price point you get
it and you feel like

892
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,600
you're are buying a $40 million home.

893
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,190
Well, that's just for the tour,

894
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,420
it's been an incredible
day, touring this home,

895
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,670
sharing it with all of you.

896
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,949
But of course this tour
will not be complete

897
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,789
unless we spent few more hours,

898
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,619
so we can show this house
to you guys at dusk.

899
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:18,202
(upbeat music)

900
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,049
Alright guys, that's it for the tour.

901
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,540
Now, before we end this video,

902
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,270
I would like to summarize
my thoughts on this house

903
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,150
and briefly talk about the neighborhood.

904
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,560
This house is located in a gated community

905
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,400
called Oaks of Calabasas
which includes 500 homes.

906
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,670
Within that gated community,

907
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,560
there's a smaller gated community called

908
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,920
the estate of the Oaks

909
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,240
which only includes 54
properties out of that 500.

910
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,820
Of those 54 homes, only 16
of them sits on a Ridge line,

911
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,770
and this property is one of them.

912
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,710
The views from the Ridge
line are incredible,

913
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,760
you guys saw it earlier.

914
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,750
We have the Santa Monica
mountains, Malibu Canyon road.

915
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,033
It's definitely a very
peaceful and tranquil setting.

916
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:29,170
On top of that we have that
amazing infinity edge pool,

917
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,380
perfectly framing that view as well.

918
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,710
Now in terms of the house,

919
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,130
my favorite two rooms are the kitchen

920
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,330
and the primary bedroom.

921
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,090
I love the kitchen design,
it looks very sleek,

922
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,830
the contrast is beautiful.

923
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,620
We have the massive Island upfront

924
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,870
and you have all the functionality
you need in that kitchen.

925
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,470
Also right around the corner
we have the caterer's kitchen,

926
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,630
which is a great compliment
to the main kitchen.

927
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,800
And I love the contrast
between the stainless steel

928
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,790
and the black glass cabinetry.

929
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,930
Primary bedroom overall was amazing.

930
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,400
You had the spacious bedroom complimented

931
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,650
with the coffee bar, two
bathrooms, two closets,

932
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,040
amazing balcony and you
had the incredible views.

933
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,000
Lastly, I wanna give
credit to the designer

934
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,760
and the developer of this project.

935
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,060
It took them six years to build this home

936
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,150
and pulling off a project like this

937
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,710
with an infinity edge pool like that

938
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,830
and making the best out of the
grounds is not an easy task.

939
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,900
For that I wanna
congratulate the developer

940
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,970
and the designer Michael Palumbo
for doing an amazing job.

941
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,830
Finishes in this house are incredible.

942
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,930
Overall, they did a great job.

943
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,860
Lastly, I want to thank the
listing agent Tomer Fridman

944
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,220
for allowing us to tour
his amazing listing.

945
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,810
