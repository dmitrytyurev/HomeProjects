1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,490
- What's up everybody.
It's Enes here.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,720
This week, we're in
Wilhelmsdorf, Germany,

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,950
and going to tour this
futuristic luxurious motor home

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,580
built by Dembell.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,670
The interior of this
motor home is stunning.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,680
And on the back, we have
a full-sized garage,

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,010
so you can take your personal car with you

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,370
anywhere you travel.

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,260
Now, this model starts
around 1 million euros,

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,430
and the particular motor
home right behind me,

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,830
with all the upgrades,

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,717
goes for 1,070,000 euros,
which is around $1,250,000.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,400
And now without further
ado, let's begin our tour.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,983
(upbeat music)

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,320
So we're gonna start our
tour on the exterior,

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,130
walk around the entire vehicle.

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,970
Then we're gonna take you guys inside.

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,340
First thing I want to mention.

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,090
This motor home is built on
a Mercedes Actros chassis.

20
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,380
You have a 12.8 liter engine V12

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,740
that gets 530 horsepower.

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,150
And check this out, Mikey.

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,700
This vehicle does 11 1/2 miles per gallon,

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,870
even though it weighs 26 tons.

25
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,703
- [Mikey] That's crazy.

26
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:38,600
What a Hummer does? Eight or
nine miles a gallon, right?

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,140
- That's right. So impressive.

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,130
And it's actually 12 meters
long, four meters tall,

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,530
2 1/2 meters wide.

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,410
So it's definitely a big vehicle.

31
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,970
Now, if we go around the side, Mikey,

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,180
I love the contemporary lines.

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,170
It's just, the motor home
looks so modern and elegant.

34
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,710
And we're used to seeing
a lot of motor homes

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,040
that are a little bit more,
let's say, old school,

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,620
but this is not the case here,

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,810
and check this out.

38
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,050
It's so elevated from the ground.

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,910
Look at the passenger side
here. It's like solid.

40
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,570
What? Like six, seven feet up there.

41
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,850
- [Mikey] It's like
climbing a ladder to get up.

42
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,683
- Exactly.

43
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:12,300
But another thing I want to mention.

44
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,800
The windshield on this thing
is a little bit more shallow.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,260
It's almost like a little bit more sporty.

46
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,430
Now that we're on this side,

47
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,860
another detail I wanna mention,

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,750
it doesn't have side
mirrors, it has side cameras.

49
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,500
And we're gonna show
you guys how that works

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,550
on the interior.

51
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,650
Now, going this way,

52
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,810
we have the first slide-out here

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,970
that kicks out about 50 centimeters.

54
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,830
That's your living room area.

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,300


56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,280


57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,630


58
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,240
And on this side, we have two folding chairs, custom designed for this motor home, where you can store it right here.
That's your storage compartment that connects all the way to the other side.

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,440



60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,400
And below here, Mikey, we
have your hydraulic pumps.

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,170
And right next to that is your
split air conditioning unit

62
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,280
for the entire motor home, super cool.

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,670
Now, right in the center,

64
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,250
we have this lit-up staircase
that leads you to the inside.

65
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,880
Push of a button, you can
actually close the staircase.

66
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,510
It flushes nicely with the exterior clad.

67
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,920
Above that you have your door

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,430
that we're gonna check out in a bit.

69
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,710
Now coming here, if you actually
look above the motor home,

70
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,080
we have four solar panels,
each producing 320 watts.

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,010
So in total you get 1,320 watts.

72
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,520
And right here, Mikey,
you have 200 amp each,

73
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,750
in total, 800 amp lithium batteries

74
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,680
to store all that electricity.

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,320
That way you can power all
the electronics in this car

76
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,820
without having the need to
turn on the diesel generator.

77
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,930
Now, Mikey, you ready?

78
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,020
Here's another cool detail
I want to point out.

79
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,870
When you close this panel here,

80
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,950
there's a nice cutout for your keypad.

81
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,675
And I cannot show you guys this code, but.

82
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,425
(keypad beeping)

83
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:42,860
- Wow.
- You can hide away

84
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,890
your stairs, just like that.

85
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,740
- [Mikey] That's sleek.

86
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,890
- It is super sleek, right? There you go.

87
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,150
Now, Mikey, two more details here.

88
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,850
Number one, these rear tires, they have steering as well.

89
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,060
That way when you're turning,
the rear tires turn as well

90
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,920
to help you with the turning radius

91
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,450
of this long vehicle, which is super cool.

92
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,430
And above us,

93
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,050
we have this motorized,
retractable awning system

94
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,920
with LED lighting on the steel
legs, which is super unique.

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,050
And above that, it's obviously
covered six meters wide,

96
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,460
3 1/2 meters in depth.

97
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,293
And on top of that,

98
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:17,290
you have a secondary motorized
screen here to lower down.

99
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,290
That way, let's say,

100
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,027
you're having your meal down below here,

101
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,820
and you don't want to get the sun,

102
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,630
you can actually avoid
it through the shade.

103
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,463
- [Mikey] That's pretty cool.

104
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,510
That thing is huge. That
really sticks out far.

105
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,360
- Exactly. And another cool detail.

106
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,230
I know too much about this RV now.

107
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,960
When the wind gets up to
39 kilometers an hour,

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,400
it automatically closes up

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,260
since it doesn't have any supporting legs.

110
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,093
- [Mikey] Wow.

111
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,650
- Super unique, right?
- Yeah.

112
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,420
- Now, speaking of
unique, this is amazing.

113
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,830
This model has a small garage

114
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,550
where you can park your smart
car, which is incredible.

115
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,090
It's also branded with
the same color theme,

116
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,970
like the rest of the motor home.

117
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,470
And it's amazing,

118
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,450
the fact that you can actually
bring your own personal car

119
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,510
wherever you travel.

120
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,860
- [Mikey] That's always
been like my biggest problem

121
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,270
with RVs in general.

122
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,140
'Cause like, usually you're
out in like national parks

123
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,290
or something, and it's like,

124
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,890
sometimes you want to
drive on a dirt road,

125
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,420
but you can't take these big cars.

126
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,440
- Or go to grocery shopping.

127
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,570
- [Mikey] Exactly. Yeah.

128
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,500
- And in this case,

129
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,910
this motor home comes with
this smart car here as well.

130
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,230
This is your garage, it's all
clad with stainless steel.

131
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,790
You have access to some
of your panels here.

132
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,010
And check this out, Mikey.

133
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,560
The way you park it inside, obviously,

134
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,500
currently, we have it on the ramp,

135
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,150
and they have a tow hook here.

136
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,423
And

137
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:28,256
(machine buzzing)

138
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,830
just like that, you pull the car inside

139
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,420
and close this hydraulic door.

140
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,253
- [Mikey] That's pretty awesome.

141
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,320
- Amazing, right?

142
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,720
Now, Mikey, let's wrap wrap
around and continue our tour.

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,710
I want to briefly talk
about the color palette,

144
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,080
and kind of like the design
elements of this motor home.

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,170
They went with this
nice, simple white color,

146
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,040
and that's the signature Dembell
red and black combination

147
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,230
right there where we
have the glass panels.

148
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,380
Over here, we have more storage
panels and access points.

149
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,420
In this case, this is, Mikey, right here

150
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,280
is where you have your heating system,

151
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,650
and access to your valves
and plumbing, and all that.

152
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,483
They use Uponor.

153
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:06,070
Uponor is one of the best in the industry.

154
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,820
I wanted to point that out.

155
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,630
And if we follow this way, Mikey,

156
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,870
we have extra storage compartments.

157
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,937
And down below is your
408 kilowatt generator,

158
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:18,820
diesel generator with a
soundproof case there.

159
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,220
That way, when it turns on,

160
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,610
you don't even hear it
inside of the motor home.

161
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,670
And what's cool about
this system that they have

162
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,770
is every time you need the generator,

163
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,970
it turns on automatically.

164
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,260
So you don't have to shift the
button or turn a switch on.

165
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,360
It's just automatically wired that way.

166
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,330
- [Mikey] It's pretty cool.
It's an American import also.

167
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,420
- That's right.
- Yeah.

168
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,540
- Now, Mikey, this is the second door

169
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,950
where it opens up to the storage unit

170
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,260
that we showed earlier.

171
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,930
Above that is your secondary slide-out.

172
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,510
This one is a little bit bigger.

173
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,820
It kicks out about 70 centimeters.

174
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,830
And that's your kitchen right there.

175
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,190
Now, lastly, we have
the driver's side here.

176
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,140
Let's take a quick look.

177
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,600
Obviously, we're gonna check
out on the inside in a bit.

178
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
I mean, it's up there.

179
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,800
- [Mikey] Yeah. It's high.

180
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,350
It's really, really cool though.

181
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,510
- Overall, I love the exterior design.

182
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,490
The whole motor home looks
so contemporary and elegant.

183
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,710
It has a young vibe to it.
You have a Mercedes chassis.

184
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,820
You can't really go wrong with that.

185
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,050
And that wraps our tour on the exterior.

186
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,540
Now, I want to open the door here.

187
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,310
So you have eight stairs
that takes you up, Mikey,

188
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,830
built-in handrail with LED lighting.

189
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,370
You can see the latches,
they're heavy duty,

190
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,083
and I'll meet you guys inside.

191
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,666
(mellow music)

192
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,057
And we go straight into
the living room area.

193
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:32,890
(door thuds)

194
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,360
Now, the interior of this
motor home is stunning.

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
In fact, Dembell uses
an interior design firm

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,510
that specializes in yacht design.

197
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,230
And their eye for beautiful
finishes, wood-clad details

198
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,710
really shows in this interior.

199
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,560
Now the first area I want
to cover is right behind me.

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,470
We have this 50 inch TV,

201
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,210
nicely recessed into this wood-clad wall.

202
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,720
And even the ceilings are covered

203
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,950
with this exquisite material,
mood lighting throughout.

204
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,260
And they also have their AC diffusers

205
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,080
nicely tucked into these panels.

206
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,100
That way you get a nice air distribution

207
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,210
throughout the space.

208
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,970
Now, I want to cover this section here.

209
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,930
This is your living room seating area.

210
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,990
You have a built-in seating here

211
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,340
with mood lighting underneath.

212
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,910
And this is your first slide-out, Mikey.

213
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,390
You even have some upper cabinets here,

214
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,190
of course, your built-in speakers.

215
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,710
It's just a cozy area for you
to sit down and watch your TV

216
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,890
since it's on a perfect angle.

217
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,330
Now, in front of the seating
area, we also have this table

218
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,020
that's currently positioned
as a coffee table.

219
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,720
And you can actually, Mikey, adjust it,

220
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
turn it this way, and have
it as a dining table as well.

221
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,713
On top of that.

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,153
- [Mikey] Oh, wow.

223
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,520
- You can lower it and
raise it if you want.

224
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,270
- [Mikey] A lot of interesting
features in this thing.

225
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,102
- Correct.

226
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:45,890
Now, I also forgot to mention this.

227
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,550
We have a skylight right in the center,

228
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,740
bringing a ton of natural
light to the space.

229
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,130
You have built-in blackout
shades also as well.

230
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,380
And Mikey, all the glass in
this motor home, is heated.

231
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,430
That way when you're
heating the motor home

232
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,010
through floor heating or
through your radiators

233
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,320
that are on each side,

234
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,180
even your skylights or
your windows are heated.

235
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,030
So you have a nice, thermal envelope.

236
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,900
- I guess they just do that

237
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,840
so like hot air doesn't
escape out the windows,

238
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,040
basically, right?
- Exactly.

239
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,730
Or let's say you're
laying down on the bed,

240
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,400
you don't have a cold
window right next to you.

241
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,810
- [Mikey] That makes sense.

242
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,780
- Amazing space. Now
let's continue our tour.

243
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,060
We have these two chairs

244
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,750
currently turned this
direction to your seating area.

245
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,090
And obviously when you're cruising,

246
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,720
you have turned the other way around.

247
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,470
But more importantly, Mikey, ready?

248
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,913
I'm gonna lower it a
tiny bit. There you go.

249
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,060
Normally, you would have
these chairs leaning back

250
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,140
so you can actually lower
this queen-sized bed

251
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,240
all the way down here.

252
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,550
And that's your additional sleeping area.

253
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,383
- [Mikey] That's pretty cool.

254
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:42,650
So at least four people can sleep in here.

255
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,890
- Comfortably.
- Yeah.

256
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,700
- And this section is super cool.

257
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,610
They have roof heating here.

258
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,370
That way you don't compromise the comfort.

259
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,270
Even in this space,

260
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,850
you have some built-in reading lights,

261
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,010
another skylight detail there,

262
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,480
plugs, kind of everything you need.

263
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,490
Another cozy spot.
- Yeah. It's really nice.

264
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,880
- And just like that, you tuck it up.

265
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,450
Now, Mikey, let's check out the cockpit.

266
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,283
- [Mikey] Let's do it.

267
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:04,400
- All right.

268
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,020
As we go in here, it's super spacious.

269
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,250
And I got to say this.

270
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,750
The cockpit of this motor
home is truly stunning.

271
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,730
You have so much space here
and visibility is great.

272
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,180
I'm currently sitting
in the driver's seat,

273
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,720
and my dashboard here
with two built-in screens,

274
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,080
it looks like I'm driving
a really nice Mercedes SUV.

275
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,330
It doesn't feel like a motor
home. You have your GPS here.

276
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,100
And we mentioned it on the exterior,

277
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,840
instead of side mirrors,
you have side cameras.

278
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,630
Obviously, your vision
is a little bit low here

279
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,920
since we have the
slide-outs open right now.

280
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,580
And Mikey, look at this,
I mean, this is your gear.

281
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,420
You have all this extra
storage, obviously.

282
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,260
All these seats that we're
sitting on, all four seats,

283
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,070
they are heated, cooled, and massaged.

284
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,370
- [Mikey] And don't forget,
they're also on hydraulics.

285
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,530
So-
- Air suspension.

286
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,580
- [Mikey] air suspension. Yeah.

287
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,620
So it feels like you're floating on these.

288
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,870
- I mean, it's amazing.

289
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,530
I'm sure it's super fun to
drive this thing around.

290
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,700
And visibility is great.

291
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,290
I don't know, it's like, I'm so impressed

292
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,680
with this motor home.
- Yeah.

293
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,730
- Now I want to take everybody back again

294
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,550
to the living room area.

295
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,690
And right across from the seating setup,

296
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,470
we have the kitchen, super modern.

297
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,160
You have glass cabinetry
throughout, glass countertops.

298
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,930
And right here, we have the
Miele induction cooktop.

299
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,040
Above that you have your
tucked in kitchen vent.

300
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,430
And here we have a nice
LED channel lighting

301
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,580
for the entire kitchen,
upper cabinets above.

302
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,010
And Mikey, I gotta show you this detail.

303
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,760
Of course, these are soft close.

304
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,593
Check this out.

305
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:33,700
They have espresso cups
branded with Dembell.

306
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,533
- [Mikey] That's pretty cool.

307
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,580
- All their cups, dishware,
everything is actually branded.

308
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,400
In fact, I'm gonna show more in a bit.

309
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,730
Down below the induction cooktop,

310
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,760
we have a Miele oven, and ready?

311
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,260
Dishwasher drawer.

312
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,283
- [Mikey] I feel like
that's not common to see.

313
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,950
- You recognize the
branding? Made by Dembell.

314
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,930
- [Mikey] We're gonna have to push Dembell

315
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,770
to give us some souvenirs to take home.

316
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,020
- That sounds cool.

317
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,370
Now, Mikey, let's check out this detail.

318
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,330
This cover plate comes
off and there you go.

319
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,520
You have your modern sink
there with a pop-up faucet.

320
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,970
There you go. Nice and sleek.

321
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,753
Let's put this cover back on.

322
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:13,240
Another good detail that I
want to mention here also.

323
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,180
They have this awning window
here that you can open up.

324
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,013
(window creaks)

325
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,230
Get some fresh air, right?

326
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,930
I love those aluminum
handles, and check this out.

327
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,640
You either have bug screen automatic

328
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,310
or your blackouts.

329
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,640
- [Mikey] And that's every opening window

330
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,830
on the whole unit, right?

331
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,663
- Exactly.

332
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,210
Throughout the entire motor home,

333
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,920
everything is motorized.
- Yeah.

334
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,210
- All the curtains and everything.

335
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,730
Now let's check out more cabinets.

336
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,490
Down below the sink, we have
additional cabinetry here.

337
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,460
Everything is nicely compartmentalized.

338
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,610
And they even utilize spaces like this one

339
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,950
to create extra storage.

340
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,370
Now, the last part of this
kitchen is right here.

341
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,900
This paneled door opens up your fridge.

342
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,793
Down below, we have the freezer.

343
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,980
And that wraps our tour for the kitchen.

344
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,440
We're back at the entry
now. This is your main door.

345
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,830
And right next to that,

346
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,280
we have an additional door opening up

347
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,820
to a small closet space,

348
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,870
where you have your control
for your AC, generator.

349
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,150
And this screen right here
controls the entire motor home.

350
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,600
You can use this for your
slide-outs, awning system,

351
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
doors, exteriors.

352
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,790
You can control anything from here.

353
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,450
Now, following this hallway,
we have a coat closet here.

354
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,210
And the first door on my right-hand side

355
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,410
goes into your bathroom.

356
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,020
Now, like the rest of the
motor home, this bathroom here

357
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,360
has some of those yacht
finishes with the curved walls.

358
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,240
LED-lit mirror, chrome
details here with your faucet.

359
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,060
Nice bowl sink.

360
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,200
This toilet right here,
Mikey, is also heated.

361
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,870
It's motorized. I mean,
this is incredible.

362
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,920
You have a LED-lit mirror
here for your makeup

363
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,460
or when you get ready.
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,800
Heated towel racks with
this Corian stone back wall.

365
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,010
And even the towel has
the Dembell branding.

366
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,990
Super cool.
- It has to.

367
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,290
- It has to, right?

368
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,170
Mood lighting here, the amount of details.

369
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,900
And of course, right behind me,

370
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,550
we have the vent on right now,

371
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,800
is your walk-in shower with
a massive rainhead above.

372
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,620
Even your showerhead is
actually a good size.

373
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,140
- [Mikey] And it's not
small in there either.

374
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,490
Go inside.

375
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,880
- Check it out.

376
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,320
You have chrome fixtures here.
I mean, it's a good size.

377
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,550
And on the back, you actually
have shampoo niche here

378
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,710
with LED lighting.
- Yeah.

379
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,510
- I mean, they thought
about it, everything.

380
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,810
And last part, Mikey,

381
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,590
this door right here
opens up to your closet

382
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,450
for your bathroom.

383
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,680
And down below you have
a washer and dryer,

384
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,230
which is something you gotta have.

385
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,890
Now, at the end of this hallway,

386
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,470
we gotta show this detail, Rimadesio

387
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,950
mirrored, pocketing door.

388
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,340
I said mirrored because you
can actually see yourself.

389
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,520
It's like a nice, full-sized mirror

390
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,250
that closes off your bedroom.

391
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,510
Mikey, come on inside.

392
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,010
Now, this space is just as cozy

393
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,650
as the rest of the motor home.

394
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,940
I love the mood lighting
that they have throughout

395
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,170
around the bed setup.

396
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,010
You have two massive windows on each side,

397
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,380
bring in natural light,
again, they're heated.

398
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,480
And of course, you have your bug screen,

399
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,780
automatic shades, blackouts,
everything you need.

400
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,530
Mikey, just like the
outside, we've been seeing

401
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,670
they have the same stainless
steel reveal detail

402
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,810
around this window opening
that looks exquisite.

403
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,130
Behind that, we have the
grille for the radiator,

404
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,240
nicely hidden behind this wood
paneling throughout the room.

405
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,073
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's really nice.

406
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:12,240
And you mentioned it was,
it looked like a yacht,

407
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,610
but it reminds me of
Bintador, a Tankoa Yacht,

408
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,040
we put on the channel a while back.

409
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,750
- Exactly. Same detail.

410
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,670
- [Mikey] Italian yachts.

411
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,250
But if you haven't seen it,
go check out that video.

412
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,710
- Make sure to check it out.
- Yeah.

413
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,470
- I mean, Mikey, overall great space.

414
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,640
I love the bed setup here, so cozy.

415
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,200
And behind the bed setup,

416
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,130
you actually have all these doors

417
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,520
that serves as your cabinetry
and your closet space.

418
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,040
In fact, the one right in
the center is actually deep

419
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,070
that goes down a little bit.

420
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,360
So you can hang your
dresses, pants, clothes,

421
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,560
all that good stuff.

422
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,780
Wall sconces on each side,
we have the nightstand here.

423
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,100
Overall, beautiful bedroom
setup, nice and cozy.

424
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,810
Now, so far we saw the
exterior and the interior

425
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,643
of this motor home,

426
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,290
and there's actually one more thing left.

427
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,940
I think we should take it out on the road

428
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,090
and see how it drives.

429
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,138
- [Mikey] Let's do it.

430
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:57,721
(mellow music)

431
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,010
- So we just took this
motor home for a ride,

432
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,930
and I gotta say, it drove so smoothly.

433
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,290
It's incredibly quiet.

434
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,510
And something about being really high,

435
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,370
it just makes it really fun.

436
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,000
Overall, you guys saw the interiors,

437
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,268
and it drives amazing as well.

438
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:25,851
(mellow music)

439
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,470
All right, everyone,
that's it for the tour.

440
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,390
What an amazing vehicle.

441
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,090
Throughout the day we saw all
the design elements, finishes,

442
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,130
and the amenities that
this motor home offers.

443
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,990
On top of that,

444
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,060
seeing how smooth this
vehicle drove on the road

445
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,240
was really impressive.

446
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,860
It was really quiet inside.

447
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,010
I gotta say, I'm a big fan.

448
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,599
As always, you can find more
information about the vehicle

449
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,219
and Dembell down in the
description of this video.

450
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,510
So make sure to check them out.

451
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,560
And lastly, if you enjoyed the tour,

452
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,750
