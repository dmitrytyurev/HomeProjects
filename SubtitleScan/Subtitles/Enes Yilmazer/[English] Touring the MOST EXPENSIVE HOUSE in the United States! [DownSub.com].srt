1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,160
- This is the biggest and
the most expensive home

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,810
currently on the market
in the United States,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,620
with an asking price of $295 million.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,080
It is also the most requested
episode on our channel,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,940
so we're really excited for this tour.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,750
Now, this home features
105,000 square feet

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,340
of interior space, 21
bedrooms, 49 bathrooms,

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,670
private nightclub, breathtaking views,

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,030
situated on this incredible promontory.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,508
And let's get started.

11
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:31,341
(eerie bass tone)

12
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:45,312
(upbeat bass music)

13
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:29,300
- The One is a property
that has been legendary

14
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
to all Angelinos for the last 12 years,

15
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,510
and worldwide in the last decade,

16
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,630
has become this iconic sort of figure.

17
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,480
It's kind of bigger than
life, it's more than a home.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,060
It's an entity.

19
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,870
And the reason why Angelinos
have followed this property

20
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,970
is because there are so many changes

21
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,800
that have taken place now in Los Angeles,

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,540
which don't allow you
to ever recreate this.

23
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,420
For one thing, there are nearly
30,000 cubic yards of dirt,

24
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,610
30,000 cubic yards of
dirt that were removed,

25
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,130
excavated to create this, okay.

26
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,240
And you are on four
acres, almost four acres,

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,860
up the longest driveway you've ever seen,

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,120
and landing on top of the hill.

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,180
One of the highest
elevations in all of Bel Air.

30
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,890
So for all of those reasons,

31
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,920
and then add the icing on the cake,

32
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,270
which is a 360 degree view.

33
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,280
You are in one of the most sought after

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,480
and iconic properties
in all of Los Angeles.

35
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,610
(relaxed music)

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,900
- We're gonna start our
tour on the motor court.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,010
Long driveway brings you up here,

38
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,290
and halfway through the driveway,

39
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,910
you actually have an entrance point

40
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,910
to your subterranean garage.

41
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,960
And behind the property,

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,040
we also have an amazing
detached guest home

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,860
that we're gonna tour later in the video.

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,530
Now, coming here, we
have this paved floors,

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,000
palm trees, amazing scale.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,110
And coming to this section,

47
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,750
we have the marble walkway
taking you to the front door.

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,180
I love the moat that they have off of the entry.

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,460
You have a art installation on your right,

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,260
two massive skylights
embedded into the pool,

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,450
allowing natural light
to the lower section.

52
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,790
And before we get in here,

53
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,860
I also want to thank the listing agents,

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,320
Rayni Williams, Branden
Williams, and Aaron Kirman

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,720
for allowing us to tour
this amazing listing.

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,220
And we will be actually talking

57
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,470
to Rayni and Brandon later in the tour.

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,110
Now, coming back here,

59
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,110
the front facade is also clad with marble.

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,210
I love the grid details
on the right hand side.

61
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,200
This overhead section
has built in LED lighting

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,500
to light up the entry, and coming here,

63
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,040
we have a fingerprint scanner,

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
and your marble door actually
recesses into the wall.

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,990
Now, coming here, this is where
we have the spacious foyer.

66
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,410
Oversized marble on the floors.

67
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,030
We have this art installation

68
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,300
right in the center, that rotates.

69
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,990
Beautiful chandelier above,
and throughout the property,

70
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,270
I'm gonna talk about the scale

71
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,450
because everything in this
house is so oversized.

72
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,100
So grand, and this is
just your entry here.

73
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,880
You have seating on
each side, suede walls,

74
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,480
and sliding glass doors

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,270
seamlessly takes you to the outdoors.

76
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,110
Now, coming back here to the entry,

77
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,930
we have this long hallway
taking us to two special rooms.

78
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,600
First, we're gonna check out the office.

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,940
Now, before we get there,
on our right hand side

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,899
we have one of the staircases
going up to the second floor.

81
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,279
And coming here, we have the office.

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,040
25 foot high ceilings,
skylight right in the center,

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,400
walls of glass facing the views.

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,270
We have water surrounding the entire room,

85
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,790
and this corner glass looks
towards your motor court.

86
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,130
Scale is amazing.

87
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,900
We have the desk set
up right in the center.

88
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,040
And the entire room is complimented

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,560
with Italian lacquer finished cabinetry,

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,670
with LED lighting, that
looks really sleek.

91
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,420
And on top of that, right above us,

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,680
we actually have the balcony
looking down on this room,

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,470
and we're gonna check that
space out later in the tour.

94
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,010
Now, bringing everybody back to the entry.

95
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,520
Again, we have the staircase on our left,

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,150
going up to the second floor.

97
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,120
This opening takes us to
a beautiful powder room

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,650
with a marble pedestal sink,

99
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,240
and marble finished
wall with a mere accent.

100
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,820
And coming here, we have the main lounge.

101
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,730
- This is the king's
lounge, where he entertains.

102
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,100
Walls of glass, explosive
views, two king palms.

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,890
You have this beautiful art wall,

104
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,410
with this 20 foot fireplace,
you have this beautiful lounge.

105
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,630
- I mean, this is amazing.

106
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,860
And Branden, furniture looks small here.

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,750
Room is so big, it's insane.

108
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,370
How many square foot
you said this room was?

109
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,750
- I think this is about 3000 square feet.

110
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,030
- That's incredible,

111
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,810
I mean, these are good sized
couches and sofa setup.

112
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,170
And it's insane, and you
have another one over there.

113
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,960
- This is the secondary lounge.

114
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,390
This is my favorite lounge because this is

115
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,990
where you have the most
explosive views in Los Angeles.

116
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,040
You have the grand piano, oversized,

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,540
and then you have the biggest
views in all of Los Angeles.

118
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,860
This is the king of the year.

119
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,350
And it has one of my favorite art pieces,

120
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,420
which is the Murano glass,
it's the angel wings.

121
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,440
And you know what that's for?

122
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,031
Because this view is why they
call it the city of angels.

123
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,531
(dance music)

124
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,625
- Now, I'm gonna take
an interesting route.

125
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm gonna bring everybody here.

126
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,810
We have the elevator
access, back to the foyer.

127
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,650
Of course, it opens up to the outdoors.

128
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,560
We're gonna check out
the backyard in a bit.

129
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,770
And coming here, we have
the formal dining room area,

130
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,370
gorgeous table right in the center,

131
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,770
that currently sits 16 people,

132
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,040
but I'm sure you can add few
more chairs on each side.

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,840
Chandeliers above, and
again, just the scale,

134
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,410
25 foot high ceilings.

135
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,540
Everything about this house is so grand.

136
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,550
Now, I wanna take everybody this way.

137
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,110
This entire glass panel actually goes

138
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,200
into your walk-in wine cellar

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,270
that is temperature controlled.

140
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,980
And these are for your big bottles.

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,960
And you have seating areas
within your wines cellar.

142
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,070
This is mind boggling.

143
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,820
We have never seen
anything quite like this.

144
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,340
Now, I wanna bring everybody back

145
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,140
to the formal dining room area.

146
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,150
This is the main hallway that
takes you from the front door.

147
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,710
And coming here, we
have an amazing opening,

148
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,150
with this art installation

149
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,860
that starts from the second floor ceiling,

150
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,120
goes down all the way to the lower level,

151
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,140
complemented with a water feature.

152
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,050
This is a polished chrome piece.

153
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,650
And I'm sure just the installation

154
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,230
of this sculpture took over a year.

155
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,410
Now, come in here.

156
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,670
We have another staircase
going up to the second floor.

157
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,210
And this is where we have the art gallery,

158
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,150
just an open space, on
our right hand side,

159
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,640
we have the moat off of the entry.

160
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,180
You have your lighting
perfectly positioned.

161
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,670
And at the end of this hallway,
we have a guest bedroom.

162
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,950
So let's go quickly check that out.

163
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,020
Seating area off of the
entry, king size bed,

164
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,130
with a patted back wall, super spacious room.

165
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,720
Has a door that opens up to
the motor cor for easy access

166
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,580
And come in here,

167
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,300
I'm trying to figure out
which details I wanna point

168
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,670
because there are so many.

169
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,260
Let's quickly check out the
bathroom, it starts here.

170
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,560
Marble floors, marble walk in shower

171
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,920
with this mosaic detailed chrome finishes.

172
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,790
Toto toilet that opens up as
you walk into the bathroom,

173
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,440
floating vanity, walk in
closet, everything you need.

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,120
Now, let's go back to the hallway.

175
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,890
And at the end of this hallway,

176
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,510
we have few powder rooms to serve

177
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,050
the first floor of this home.

178
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,640
It starts right here,

179
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,000
we have a gorgeous marble
pedestal sink, chrome fixtures,

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,700
another Toto toilet, everything you need.

181
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,650
Now, coming back to the hallway,
we're gonna go this way.

182
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,299
We'll be walking a lot in this home.

183
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,509
I mean, Mikey, look at the
scale here, I just keep walking.

184
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,679
- [Mikey] Yeah, I haven't gotten
the chance to talk much yet

185
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,529
because I'm a little bit overwhelmed.

186
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,619
We've done a lot of walking already,

187
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,560
but we've really just
started, so let's keep going.

188
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,280
- Absolutely, double doors
open up to your library.

189
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,430
Now, I say library,

190
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,690
but this room actually
has built in ventilation

191
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,850
for a cigar lounge, that way
you can actually smoke here

192
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,310
and you won't even smell.

193
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,240
In fact, Mikey, let's get a close up here.

194
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,020
You can see all these
built-ins with chrome details.

195
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,520
I love the veneer of the wood cabinetry

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,142
and the gloss finish.

197
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:11,140
You have the seating
area right in the center.

198
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,600
Vintage "Playboy" covers on this side,

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,110
which is a unique detail.

200
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,560
And I personally love those wall sconces

201
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,630
that are brass finished and oversized.

202
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,070
- [Mikey] And if there's a bunch
of vintage "Playboy" covers

203
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,210
on the wall, and you're talking
about brass wall fixtures.

204
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,150
- I'm just trying to keep
it straight line here.

205
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,530
We got a lot to cover on this house,

206
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,270
so I'm just trying to keep it quick.

207
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,100
It's a cool touch, open
shelving, TV, more storage,

208
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,950
and humidors, and everything you need.

209
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,390
All right, let's go back to the hallway

210
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,223
and continue our tour.

211
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,830
By the way, Mikey, can
you expose to the outside?

212
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,130
Look at the views here.

213
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,600
We have Downtown Los Angeles
from every angle of this home.

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,570
This is just amazing.

215
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,240
Of course, you have
sliding glass doors here,

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,330
opening up to the
outdoors and coming here.

217
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,030
This is where we have the
family room and the kitchen.

218
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm gonna start our tour on the kitchen.

219
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,050
It is super sleek, I love
this polished cabinetry.

220
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,570
Waterfall edge on the island.

221
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,330
This is for sure one
of the biggest islands

222
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,850
we have ever seen on this
channel, nicely decorated.

223
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,230
Glass panels, I mean, look
how sleek these details are.

224
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,440
I'm pretty sure this
is a rose gold finish,

225
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,330
which is something we
don't see quite often.

226
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,350
And of course, you have
your Miele built ins,

227
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,790
two induction cooktops with a popup vent.

228
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,350
Builtin espresso maker, sorry, Mikey,

229
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,480
I'm pushing your left and
right, but these are cool.

230
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,573
I wanna have one of these.

231
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:25,878
- [Mikey] We've seen one of those before.

232
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:26,711
- We have tried one of these before.

233
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:27,544
- Yeah, actually in another one

234
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,410
of Rayni and Branden's listings.

235
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,880
- That is correct, all right.

236
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,550
We have two Miele induction
cooktops here, with popup vents.

237
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,090
Right next to that, we
have the first prep sink,

238
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,920
second one on this side, pop up plugs.

239
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,110
Very modern, very sleek kitchen.

240
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,360
Now, let's go back into the family room

241
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,770
so we can check out the
seating section over there.

242
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,350
Two L-shaped couches,

243
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,630
gorgeous coffee table right in the center.

244
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,910
I love the chandelier
ceiling lighting over here,

245
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,270
that really ties the space.

246
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,250
Of course, you have your
recessed in TV to the wall.

247
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,890
Linear gas fire place,
suede walls, cozy room.

248
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,020
Marble clad wall on that side,

249
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,680
and sliding glass doors
opening up to the outdoors.

250
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,970
Mikey, let's go check it out.

251
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,500
And I also wanna mention,

252
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,950
they're still putting some
of the finishing touches

253
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,370
in this estate, they're
still working certain areas.

254
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,280
We cannot tour it all,

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,870
but we're gonna try to do our best

256
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,930
to show you guys everything, right.

257
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,380
We have another hallway here,

258
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,340
powder room for this part of the home.

259
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,450
and coming here, of course,

260
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,900
these massive sliding glass
doors open up to the outdoors.

261
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,950
As soon as you walk in,

262
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,200
Downtown Los Angeles is
right in front of you.

263
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,090
This is just incredible, the views here,

264
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,010
the scale of this property,
the scale of this backyard.

265
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,350
In fact, Mikey, let's take
everybody to the grass section.

266
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,830
I love these palm trees that are right

267
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,300
in the center of the backyard.

268
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,910
To give everybody a quick
scale, that's the foyer.

269
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,250
That's the main lounge
that we toured earlier.

270
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,400
We have the bedrooms on the second floor

271
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,790
and the lower level that
we're gonna see in a bit,

272
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,860
but more importantly, look at these views.

273
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,570
And they did a really clever touch here.

274
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,700
They have a 400 foot jogging trail

275
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,210
that's right below this moat.

276
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,370
That way they have the
glass railing there,

277
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,290
since this property's on a hillside,

278
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,210
which allows this moat
to have no glass railing.

279
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,270
And from any part of the first
floor or the second floor,

280
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,069
you'll look at your views undisrupted.

281
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:20,600
This is simply amazing.

282
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,590
I mean, you can literally see

283
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,780
the mountains all the way back.

284
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,940
Hollywood Hills, Downtown,
Century City is down below you,

285
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,320
Pacific Ocean, these are without a doubt,

286
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,800
one of the best views we have
ever seen on this channel.

287
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,900
Mikey, you look a little speechless.

288
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,060
- [Mikey] We're just so high up here too.

289
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,450
But I was actually looking behind me

290
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,400
at the ocean views over here,
which we'll see in a second.

291
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,130
- Absolutely, now, we're
coming to the side backyard.

292
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,490
Let's just call it that.

293
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,520
We have the jacuzzi
here, which is oversized.

294
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,500
Marble floors, even on the outdoor.

295
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,840
That's your covered
patio space right there,

296
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,820
with a massive built in TV.

297
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,000
And this is your main pool
that has three infinity edges,

298
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,800
marble clad, mosaic on the bottom.

299
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,560
And you get so much outdoor space.

300
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,370
I mean, property is pretty
big, let's just face it.

301
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,575
- [Mikey] Yeah.

302
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,580
- And not only you get amazing
interior square footage,

303
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,340
you get a lot of outdoor square footage.

304
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,410
And I wanna particularly
cover this section

305
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,780
because you have so many
more amenities on this wing.

306
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,940
You have an outdoor dining area,

307
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,230
another covered seating,
with TV, small wet bar.

308
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,390
And right behind this section,
we have the outdoor kitchen.

309
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,400
This is without a doubt,

310
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,360
one of the best outdoor kitchen slash barbecue areas we have ever seen in any residential home.

311
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,970


312
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,870
You have so much cabinetry,
multiple fridges,

313
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,810
ice maker, teppanyaki, sink.

314
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,630
And focusing into the other side.

315
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,310
Of course, you have your outdoor grill,

316
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,630
warming drawers, vent above,
and you have more grills here,

317
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,650
literally everything you need.

318
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,200
And that wraps our tour on
the exterior and the backyard.

319
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,910
Now, I wanna take everybody back inside

320
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,710
so we can check out the lower level.

321
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:55,036
(upbeat music)

322
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,140
- This is the biggest home in the world,

323
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,360
at a 105,000 square feet of living space.

324
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,690
It is divided up by a structure
of 30,000 square feet,

325
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,930
that is actually the home, and
then under belly of the home,

326
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,820
which includes a nightclub, a four lane bowling alley,

327
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,300
a spa, a gym, and when I
say gym and when I say spa,

328
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,990
I mean, it's really so
much more than that,

329
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,770
and you're gonna get into those details.

330
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,160
But this encompasses anything and everything you could ever imagine in a home.

331
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,140


332
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,480
We decided to do something really exciting

333
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,790
and never been done before on
a property of this caliber.

334
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,720
So myself, Branden
Williams, and Aaron Kirman

335
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
are going to take this, along
with Concierge's Auction,

336
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
out to the world.

337
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,660
And we're going to allow
the bidding process

338
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,630
to be won over by the
person that really wants

339
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,530
to make this their home, their everything,

340
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,001
because this is so much more than a home.

341
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:54,501
(dance music)

342
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,860
- All right, everyone,

343
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,150
here we are on the lower floor landing.

344
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,490
Before we continue our tour here,

345
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,780
I wanna turn back and talk about

346
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,820
this floating marble staircase design.

347
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,670
I say floating because it's actually

348
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,860
not attached to the wall here.

349
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,480
And it's all clad with marble,

350
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,730
has the recessed wall
lighting, glass railing,

351
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,270
and you come to the
landing of the lower level.

352
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,850
First, we have this
art gallery space here,

353
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,657
and I wanna take everybody this side.

354
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:24,890
Like I mentioned earlier,

355
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,890
we're gonna walk a lot in this house.

356
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,450
This door actually opens up

357
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,059
to the subterranean 50 car garage.

358
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,810
They're still working on the house

359
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,490
and finishing some of the areas,

360
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,910
but I wanted to bring everybody here

361
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,840
because this is a great space.

362
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,320
Massive door opens up from the
driveway and brings you here.

363
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,010
We have all this lighting on the ceiling.

364
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,100
And they went with darker
tones for this space.

365
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,550
Now, coming back here,
marble floors throughout.

366
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,530
I wanna talk about the feature
wall that's in front of us.

367
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,250
With the butterfly
details and the portraits,

368
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,070
multiple seating areas,
and the space continues.

369
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,000
I mean, look at this hallway
here, this is incredible.

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,970
Now, we have a seating area on this side,

371
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,903
with beautiful laquer
cabinetry, recessed in TV.

372
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:11,390
And we have two guest
suites on this level.

373
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,700
First one starts right here,
spacious room, king size bed,

374
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,440
sliding glass doors open
up to a private balcony.

375
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,410
And of course, this room also
has a full size bathroom.

376
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,510
Now, coming back here to the landing,

377
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,090
right next to the seating area.

378
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,890
We have this hallway taking us

379
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,990
to the second guest suite on this level.

380
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,780
Same finishes, darker
carpet on the floors.

381
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,320
King size bed, sliding glass
doors open up to a balcony.

382
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,180
And of course, this one
also has a full bathroom.

383
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,730
Now, coming back to the landing,

384
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,240
we're gonna go this direction.

385
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
On my right hand side we have

386
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,090
the elevator access and
some utility access.

387
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,950
And coming here, we have
another lounge area.

388
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,840
The amount of seating areas in this house

389
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,740
is kind of mind boggling.

390
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,500
Another U-shaped couch,
a linear gas fireplace.

391
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,250
I like the wall textures
that they have on this side.

392
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,130
And right here,

393
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,250
we have this marble table right
in the center of this room.

394
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,410
And this will essentially
be your wine cellar,

395
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,210
storage areas, they're of
course, temperature controlled,

396
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,530
another great common area on this level.

397
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,690
- [Mikey] Yeah, and
it's kind of hard to see

398
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,339
from the camera, but these wine cellars,

399
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,819
they don't have anything
in them right now,

400
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,329
but they're really deep.

401
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,329
They're 10 feet deep behind each

402
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,269
of these glass panels.
- Easy.

403
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,310
- [Mikey] So I'm sure once you put

404
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,190
your storage racks in
there, it's gonna fit a lot.

405
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,560
- I'm sure, incredible, I'm outta words.

406
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,620
Another bar, darker tones
with lighter counter tops.

407
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,500
And they used the darker finishes
on the walls here as well.

408
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,830
Of course, you have your sink, fridge,

409
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,730
another seating area behind it,

410
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,360
another seating area on this side,

411
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,160
another lounge on this level,

412
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,210
and we're gonna continue our tour.

413
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,760
Mikey, what do you like so far?

414
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,820
- [Mikey] It's hard to
argue with that backyard,

415
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,310
and that pool area,

416
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,770
but I think what we're about to see

417
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,000
is probably one of the
coolest parts of the house.

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,910
- This is the brains of the house.

419
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,360
And they spent so much money,

420
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,620
and it takes so much space
that they wanted to make it

421
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,770
a feature wall kind of a section.

422
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,360
That's why they have
this enclosed glass here.

423
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,860
And there you go, if you
wanna power a house like this,

424
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,360
with all iPads and all that,
this is what you need to do.

425
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,193
- [Mikey] Yeah.

426
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:18,366
- Amazing.

427
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,199
- [Mikey] That's not what
I was talking about though.

428
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,032
- What are you were talking about?

429
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,210
- [Mikey] Well, what
we're about to see now

430
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,770
is my favorite part.
- Oh, okay.

431
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,883
Yes, of course, I hear you.

432
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:27,630
Another powder room on this level.

433
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,280
And look at this hallway,
I like these art pieces.

434
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,210
It's creative, we could've
came up with that idea.

435
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,490
- [Mikey] Well, the best
art is always simple.

436
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,560
- There you go, another powder
room, gorgeous cabinetry.

437
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,933
I'm sure we're gonna see many
more bathrooms, let's see.

438
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,660
These are locker closets,

439
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,360
and kind of like basically
full size bathrooms,

440
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,920
his and hers, for your gym.

441
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,470
And when I say gym,

442
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,610
I'm not talking about a couple
hundred square foot room,

443
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,260
I'm talking about an amazing space,

444
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,710
and look at the scale here.

445
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,780
I mean, walls of glass opening up.

446
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,440
Is a little dark right now,

447
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,113
but you have the sparkling
sit in front of you.

448
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,950
This space, I'm outta words.

449
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,340
You literally have every
thing you can think of.

450
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,930
I like these ceiling mount
TVs, darker carpet here.

451
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,790
And right on the other
side we have a juice bar.

452
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,540
I say juice bar, but this
is a commercial kitchen.

453
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,130
I mean, the amount of cabinetry.

454
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,350
All you're missing is a stove and event,

455
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,910
and you have a commercial kitchen.

456
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,430
I like the bar seating, you
have all your equipment here.

457
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,530
This is where you drink your fresh juice.

458
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,000
Do your yoga, work out, and
it continues on this side,

459
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
and you have a living wall here.

460
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,500
I mean, this is mind boggling.

461
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,660
- [Mikey] Yeah, so if
you live in this house,

462
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,790
do you make your own juice?

463
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,910
- It depends what type of person you are.

464
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,970
- [Mikey] Yeah, I guess you
probably have someone on staff

465
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,750
that could just make some good
juice anytime you want it.

466
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,583
- Most likely.

467
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,416
- [Mikey] Yeah.

468
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,430
- Most likely, all right,
ready, indoor pool.

469
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,060
- My favorite room in that
house is the wellness center

470
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,740
because I've seen a million of them.

471
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,270
I've seen so many cold
plunges, and jacuzzis,

472
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,860
and hot tubs, and steam
showers, and saunas,

473
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,310
but this has something different.

474
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,100
This has an indoor lap
pool, it's about 90 feet.

475
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,560
Salt water, triple osmosis.

476
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,550
And above it, it just has green walls,

477
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,540
and it feels sort of like you're outside,

478
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,990
and you're just exercising
and swimming in this space.

479
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,242
And then it also has all
of the things I just said,

480
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:26,480
that have become common to us.

481
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,180
Which is the cold plunge,
and the dry sauna,

482
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,240
and the wet steam, and
all of those things.

483
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,620
And I think that all the
gyms that I've ever seen,

484
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,070
all the wellness centers
that I've ever seen,

485
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,333
this really touches on that
title in a whole different way.

486
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:45,000
(siren musical tone)

487
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,410
- And of course, scale
needs to match the house.

488
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,020
It's massive, salt water,
love the simple plaster.

489
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,670
Lights changing, you have
a mirrored ceiling detail,

490
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,300
with cold lighting, multiple seating areas

491
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,080
and lounge areas, sliding glass doors.

492
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,180
This is probably the best indoor pool area

493
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,320
in the city, with these kind of views.

494
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,943
And again, amazing.

495
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,992
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's crazy.

496
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:10,600
- Outta words, living wall,
built in bench seating,

497
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,980
and it continues, Mikey.

498
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,770
By the way, this is the
hallway that we just walked.

499
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,603
And of course,

500
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:18,600
you have these automatic
sliding glass doors here.

501
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,060
Now, you will have
another set on this side.

502
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,310
It connects to, I
believe, powder room here.

503
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,870
And coming to this section,

504
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,190
you have another seating
area with a cold plunge,

505
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,640
two massage rooms, amazing views.

506
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,070
This chandelier right in the center

507
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,820
is probably one of the
biggest we've ever seen.

508
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,160
And first, I wanna go this way.

509
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,063
This is a full sized salon.

510
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,400
Maybe full size doesn't do justice,

511
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,260
it's like a commercial salon.

512
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,110
You have pedicure chairs, you
have hair washing stations.

513
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,590
You have chairs for you to
sit down and get a haircut.

514
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,490
And they have this nice kind of rose gold

515
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,840
and burgundy wool panels here,

516
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,560
which is kind of a retro detail.

517
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,940
LED lighting throughout, in another space,

518
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,700
it's part of your spa.

519
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,893
Now, coming back here, your spa continues.

520
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,730
And over here we have the steam showers,

521
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,660
walk in showers, heated
benches, where you sit down.

522
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,490
And in fact, they have
water lines on this section,

523
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,080
so you basically get water poured on you.

524
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,390
Have a dry sun on the other side,

525
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,100
and they're all built
like commercial spas,

526
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,970
where you have massive showers

527
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,930
and steam showers that can
accommodate up to 20 people.

528
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,480
- [Mikey] I'm a little bit lost right now.

529
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm sure audiences also,
but show us how we get back.

530
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,073
- All, right, so we're basically
doing a full circle, right.

531
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,530
I just realized there's a powder room here

532
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,240
with a gorgeous marble
sink, and another wet bar.

533
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,120
And coming here, from
an interesting angle,

534
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,670
we just came to the bowling alley.

535
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,050
So now we're doing kind of almost like

536
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,300
a full circle on the lower level.

537
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,150
We have a golf simulator here,

538
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,850
of course, why not, if
you have a bowling alley,

539
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,490
it just compliments it.

540
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,743
This bowling alley is not a
residential bowling alley.

541
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,450
This is as if it was in a
hotel, and am I outta words?

542
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,300
I feel like I'm actually
doing a bad job explaining

543
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,714
some of the details.

544
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:18,720
- [Mikey] Well, there's a lot.

545
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,710
- This is a lot to talk about.

546
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,968
- [Mikey] I don't blame you, this is wild.

547
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:22,960
- We have here--

548
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,270
- [Mikey] We've seen
bowling alleys before,

549
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,720
but usually it's one lane, maybe two.

550
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,360
- And some of, they're
a little bit shorter.

551
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,690
It's just everything about it.

552
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,680
- [Mikey] It's like a full
size four lane bowling alley.

553
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,140
- Just incredible, wall
panels with LED lighting.

554
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,370
You have the TVs above,
amazing, just amazing.

555
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,630
All right, let's continue.

556
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,530
We mentioned this multiple times.

557
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,730
They're still working on
the house, so in this case,

558
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,520
I think they're doing some
touch up to the paint,

559
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,010
but this is your tequila bar.

560
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,070
I love this back lit glass detail here.

561
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,810
They have it on the bar
display too, all open shelving.

562
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,120
Normally this would be your seating area.

563
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,570
And let's go back to the main hallway.

564
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,670
If I'm not lost here, let's see.

565
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,730
At the end of this
hallway, behind that wall,

566
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,563
we have the nightclub.

567
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:10,260
But first, I actually wanna
take everybody this way.

568
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,320
We have few powder rooms here,

569
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,150
and that's the main staircase
that we came down from.

570
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,050
And before we wrap up there,

571
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,420
I actually wanna take everybody this way.

572
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,020
There you go, I'm learning this house.

573
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,853
- [Mikey] Yeah.

574
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:28,853
- So another hallway, this
hallway takes us to a candy room.

575
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,200
This is a colorful touch to this estate.

576
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,030
We have these candy stations running

577
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,070
all the way to the ceiling.

578
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,890
LED lighting, round cabinetry.

579
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,110
I gotta give credit to
the developers here.

580
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,050
This is a nice detail,

581
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,770
and it's located perfectly
right off the entry

582
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,800
of the movie theater,

583
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,610
and this movie theater is something else.

584
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,770
In fact, Mikey, I'm gonna go left.

585
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,840
Why don't you go to the right?

586
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,370
Meet me at the movie theater

587
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,083
so everybody can get a full
scale of this amazing space.

588
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,610
Here we are, this is the movie theater.

589
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,180
I mean, calling this a movie
theater doesn't do justice.

590
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,560
This is a commercial movie theater.

591
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,380
And it's so decked out, with
the carpet, plush walls.

592
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,210
Dolby Atmos surround sound.

593
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,010
These recliner chairs, that may
look like comfortable sofas,

594
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,210
but you have all the amenities there.

595
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,970
Individual lighting,
and the ceiling heights,

596
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,583
the size of the screen here.

597
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,470
We have seen a lot amazing movie theaters.

598
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,660
I mean, a lot throughout the world,

599
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,710
but this one takes the win for me

600
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,400
because I would love to sit down here,

601
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,290
look at this massive
screen, and watch a movie.

602
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,070
Let's see if I can get this thing to work.

603
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,300
- [Mikey] You're like, and
watch some Enes Yilmazer videos.

604
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,730
- That's right, I'm trying
to make this work, Mikey.

605
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,349
And it's not pulling,
it's not doing anything.

606
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:51,160
Oh, there you go, I
mean, isn't this amazing?

607
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,750
I'm outta words, again,

608
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,410
some of the common areas in this house

609
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,670
is unlike anything we've ever seen before.

610
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,070
And that wraps our tour on this level

611
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,490
or on this part of this home.

612
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,490
I actually wanna take everybody outside

613
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,534
so we can check out the night club.

614
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:07,034
(dance music)

615
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,990
- This is the charity event room.

616
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,500
What would you call this room?

617
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,810
- I would call it a nightclub,

618
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,080
but I mean, it's just perfect
for any kind of utilization.

619
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,670
Obviously it's super open.

620
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,290
You have the commercial setup
for your events, speakers.

621
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,520
Not to mention this
massive screen here, bar.

622
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,353
It's pretty crazy.

623
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,610
- And more views.

624
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,443
- More views.

625
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:32,710
- 5,000 Square foot rooms
separate from the house.

626
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,990
So if you wanna throw an
event or an after party,

627
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,300
you bring 'em down here.

628
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,550
- Has a private entrance.

629
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,977
- Huge dance floor, huge
outdoor fire pit club.

630
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,960
And this is basically where you just get your groove on.

631
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,000
- That's right, you have the DJ booth,

632
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,090
you have the VIP lounge.

633
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,175
- And one of my favorite things,

634
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:52,920
the fire pit right over the view.

635
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,460
And this is another pool,

636
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,520
so if you wanna swim in
between all the fire pits,

637
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,600
you're right here.

638
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,340
- Branden, we got pretty
lucky, look at the views.

639
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,173
This is incredible,

640
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:04,490
I mean, you have Downtown
Los Angeles perfectly framed

641
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,700
in front of you.

642
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,990
- Well, this is why we
have the perfect weather

643
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,540
in Los Angeles, you don't
even feel the weather.

644
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,450
It's the perfect time, and
what is this right now,

645
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,810
70 something agrees?

646
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,205
- Yeah.

647
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:16,350
- Views, and we're in the dead of winter.

648
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,310
- This is amazing, Branden,
I need you to go in there.

649
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,030
Show people the scale, I
mean, this is incredible.

650
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,910
I mean, the scale here, just
the fire pit in the center,

651
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,940
it's pretty mind boggling.

652
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,930
- And this is where you're
entertaining with your friends.

653
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,427
And then if you want to
take a dip in the pool,

654
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:34,520
and you got this incredible water feature,

655
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,540
and this is the subterranean
level, the lower level,

656
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,933
but views all around.

657
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:42,497
(dance music)

658
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,590
- Here we are on the second floor landing.

659
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,470
We have beautiful hardwood
floors throughout,

660
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,677
seating area on my left.

661
00:27:49,677 --> 00:27:52,440
But first I wanna actually
take everybody this way.

662
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,910
So we talked about this detail

663
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,650
on the first floor in the office,

664
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,220
and this is the overlook area.

665
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,080
And from here, you can really
get a true scale of this room.

666
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,060
We have a massive sky light above us,

667
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,200
cabinetry goes all the
way up to the ceiling,

668
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,850
walls of glass, just amazing.

669
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,060
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's crazy.

670
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,690
- This house is just unlike
anything else we have ever seen.

671
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,989
We're tired, we're out of
breath just walking through.

672
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:16,982
- [Mikey] Yeah.

673
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:18,210
- Now, we're gonna try to do our best

674
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,050
to show you guys as much as possible

675
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,630
because that's what we are known for.

676
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,580
We have four bedroom suites on this level.

677
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,220
Let's check out the first one here.

678
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,510
Gorgeous finishes here,
with king size bed,

679
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,450
patted back wall, suede wall on this side,

680
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,780
breathtaking views, I love
that Juliet balcony detail.

681
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,150
Of course, you have
your full bathroom here,

682
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,830
with marble clad back
walls, floating vanity,

683
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,230
walk in shower, everything you need.

684
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,540
Now, this is one of the access points

685
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,040
to the rooftop deck that we're
gonna check out in a bit.

686
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,170
And that right there is a
powder room for the landing.

687
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,003
Now, coming here,

688
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:52,700
this hallway takes us
to few other bedrooms.

689
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,400
This is where we have the second one.

690
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,000
This one is facing more
towards the backyard.

691
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,370
Of course, has a full bathroom too.

692
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,390
And coming here,

693
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,350
these are the two best
bedrooms we have on this wing.

694
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,050
Let's quickly check out this one here.

695
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,140
Of course, comes with
the king size bed setup,

696
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,850
hardwood floors, walls of glass,

697
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,310
facing these incredible views.

698
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,860
I mean, it literally looks
like a movie over here.

699
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,960
- [Mikey] Yeah, again, it's
an incredibly clear day today,

700
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,460
but the ocean,

701
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,160
I don't think we've ever seen a view

702
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,510
of the ocean quite like this.

703
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,120
- Absolutely, unless you go to Malibu.

704
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,920
- [Mikey] Yeah, I guess we
are a little bit farther west

705
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,430
than we usually are in the Hills.

706
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,263
- Correct.

707
00:29:29,263 --> 00:29:30,096
- [Mikey] But still, it's
a great view of the ocean.

708
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:32,790
- It's an amazing view, look
at the scale here, Mikey.

709
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,902
Let's quickly check out the bathroom.

710
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:37,950
I mean, if we were to tour
every single room in detail,

711
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,680
this would be a three hour walkthrough.

712
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,470
Another Toto toilet,

713
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,860
I love this finish that they
have on these marble walls,

714
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,670
chrome fixtures, handheld,
floating vanities,

715
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,948
with this recessed in sink
design, that just looks gorgeous.

716
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:54,010
All right, Mikey, one more
room to see on this wing

717
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,640
so we can show it to everyone.

718
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,420
Again, we're gonna try our best,

719
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,956
there are so many rooms to see.

720
00:29:58,956 --> 00:30:00,310
All right, come in here.

721
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,820
We have the last bedroom on this wing.

722
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,960
This one is the biggest, has
the same hardwood floors,

723
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,611
king size bed.

724
00:30:07,611 --> 00:30:09,510
I just love the furnishings here too,

725
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,310
very minimalist, very to the point.

726
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,130
And before we check out the bathroom,

727
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,110
I actually wanna bring everybody here.

728
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,930
Another massive recessed
back steel column,

729
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,510
that way you have your
sliding glass doors pocketing

730
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,370
into the wall, opening up to this balcony

731
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,520
where you can appreciate
these views little bit more.

732
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,230
You have the art installation right at the edge of the promentory.

733
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,150
right at the edge of the promentory.

734
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,740
And this is unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

735
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,260
This is just truly mind boggling.

736
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,680
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's incredible.

737
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,500
- All right, Mikey, let's go back inside

738
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,630
so we can show everyone
bathroom the for this bedroom.

739
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,550
Starts here, marble
finishes, floating vanity,

740
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,570
with the same sink design.

741
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,630
Free standing tub here,
with a chrome tub filler.

742
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,220
Walk in shower, same darkened
stone is also used here.

743
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,690
Of course, you have a walk-in closet,

744
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,460
pretty much everything you need.

745
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,290
Now, let's take everybody back

746
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,970
to the landing on the second floor.

747
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,270
We have this minimalist seating area here,

748
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,680
with another TV, suede walls.

749
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Nice welcoming seating area

750
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,320
for all these four bedrooms
that we just toured.

751
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,080
Now, coming back to this floating hallway,

752
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,330
we can actually take a look

753
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,350
at the skylights bringing natural light

754
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,500
to the first floor and the lower level,

755
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,030
perfectly positioned.

756
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,800
And over here, you can actually
look down on your foyer,

757
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,670
which is just incredible.

758
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,730
I mean, look at the
scale of this chandelier.

759
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,070
I think this is the biggest chandelier

760
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,350
we have ever seen on this channel.

761
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,118
- [Mikey] Yeah, it's wild.

762
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:37,120
- A lot of firsts on this tour, for sure.

763
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,650
Now, glass railing all throughout.

764
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,440
Looking down, we have
the formal dining room.

765
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,570
You can actually see the
scale of the chandeliers too.

766
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,470
And coming back here,

767
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,330
we can take a closer look
at the art installation

768
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,600
that we talked about on the
main level here, looks gorgeous.

769
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,200
And even this section
frames a perfect view

770
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,610
of the Getty and the Pacific Ocean.

771
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,000
Now, coming back here,

772
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,040
we have the hallway continue on this side.

773
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,870
If you guys remember,
off of the motor court,

774
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,200
this is the section where we
have those metal grid details.

775
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,280
Another art gallery here,
lighting is perfectly positioned.

776
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,950
You even have the seating area.

777
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,330
And at the end of this hallway,

778
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,560
we have another guest bedroom.

779
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,610
This room is facing the
backside of the property.

780
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,760
Another king size bed, walls of glass,

781
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,570
opening up to a private balcony,

782
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,010
where you have the canyon views.

783
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,210
You can actually look
down on your guest home

784
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,030
and the tennis court,
Pacific Ocean on this side.

785
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,390
The rooms, the size, the
lengths, I'm outta words.

786
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,420
- [Mikey] Yeah.

787
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,250
- All right, here we
have the full bathroom.

788
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,870
Another floating vantage design,

789
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,750
finishes are nicely uniform.

790
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,620
And another electric toilet.

791
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,530
God knows how much they had to
spend just on toilets alone.

792
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,067
- [Mikey] How many bathrooms again?

793
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:51,750
- 49 bathrooms, so I'm
assuming at least 49 toilets.

794
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,730
Probably more.

795
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,970
- [Mikey] Okay, it's not a
bathroom without a toilet, right?

796
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,750
- Yeah, but they may have multiple,

797
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,640
like in the nightclub and other areas.

798
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,710
- Yeah, that's wild.

799
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,430
I'm sure each of those is
probably $1,500 at least.

800
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,020
- I would say five, six grand at least.

801
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,950
- [Mikey] I mean, yeah,
I'm from South Texas.

802
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,970
That's how much that toilet
costs there in a nice house.

803
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,420
- I feel you, I mean, this is incredible.

804
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,000
Walk in shower, walk in
closet, everything you need.

805
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,220
Now, I wanna take everybody
back to the hallway.

806
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,750
And this wing takes us to
the primary bedroom suite.

807
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,930
Before we go in, elevator
access on our left, suede walls,

808
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,140
and these double doors
open up to the seating area

809
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,260
for the primary bedroom suite.

810
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,610
Nice couch set up, another
linear gas fireplace.

811
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,600
TVs nicely recessed into the wall.

812
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,520
And this room comes with its own bar.

813
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,550
Now, what I like about this bar design

814
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,450
or the cabinetry particular,

815
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,650
is the fact that it curves the wall.

816
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,690
Which is always a very
sleek and timeless detail.

817
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,780
You have another built in espresso maker.

818
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,530
You have your microwave, sink,
fridges, everything you need.

819
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,240
I'm assuming if you live
in a house like this,

820
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,370
you probably have
someone here serving you.

821
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,730
- [Mikey] I know you
all haven't seen it yet,

822
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,900
but this primary bedroom
in size and scale,

823
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,000
would probably cost five to $10 million

824
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,840
anywhere else in Beverly Hills or Bel Air,

825
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,673
or something like that, right?

826
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:08,639
- It could easily be a
standalone home on its own,

827
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,609
it's mind boggling.

828
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,443
- [Mikey] Yeah.

829
00:34:10,443 --> 00:34:12,196
- All right, we have the island here.

830
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,260
That's it for the seating area

831
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,040
for the primary bedroom suite.

832
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,270
Now, let's continue our
tour on this hallway.

833
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,610
I love the vertical lighting
that they have on the walls,

834
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,820
going all the way to the ceiling.

835
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,570
This opening here takes
us to the first bathroom.

836
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:28,310
Oversized stone application
is also brought here.

837
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,750
We have a nice prep area, your
steam shower on this side,

838
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,500
walk in shower here,
with a massive rain head.

839
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,530
And again, just stone clad all the way,

840
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,790
with chrome fixtures, just gorgeous.

841
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,199
You have your vanity design here,

842
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,939
with glass countertops, of
course, free standing tub,

843
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,469
perfectly positioned towards the views.

844
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:50,969
And you have a nice Juliete
balcony detail here.

845
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,279
If you wanna slide open this door

846
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,090
and have fresh air coming
into this bathroom.

847
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,700
Now, here we have the first closet,

848
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,440
and this closet is gorgeous.

849
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,850
It feels like we're walking
into a high end boutique store.

850
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,160
Every detail, the way they
line the cabinetry here,

851
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,993
the soft cloth,

852
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:12,720
how the tracks are
underneath the cabinetry.

853
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,700
The rose gold finish, glass
cabinet fronts, chandelier here.

854
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,240
I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

855
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,810
If I wanted to do an episode here,

856
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,380
I feel like I can easily do an episode

857
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,870
just on the cabinetry here alone.

858
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,251
- [Mikey] Yeah

859
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,084
- It's gorgeous, now, Mikey,

860
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:32,209
let's take everybody
back to the hallway again

861
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:33,510
so we can tour the second bathroom,

862
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,590
which has more of the darker tones.

863
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,810
This one has more of the lighter
and kind of neutral tones.

864
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,740
Now, bedroom starts here,

865
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,360
but first let's go through this door

866
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,960
to check out the second bathroom.

867
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,040
As soon as you walk in,

868
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,670
you see this massive Jetta
tub right in the center.

869
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,503
And behind me,

870
00:35:49,503 --> 00:35:53,160
we have these glass doors
opening up to the water closet.

871
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,220
Walk in shower, with the rain head,

872
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,240
and we have this steam shower here.

873
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,760
Literally everything you can think of.

874
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,630
Sliding glass doors open
up to a private balcony

875
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,230
for the primary bedroom.

876
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,340
And over here, we have
this gorgeous cabinetry,

877
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:12,310
with marble clad doors,
fabricated sink, chrome fixtures.

878
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,130
Just gorgeous finishes throughout.

879
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,170
Now, come in here, we have
the second walk in closet.

880
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,600
Island in the center, more
of the darker tones here.

881
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,430
Again, laquer finish, LED
lighting, glass panels.

882
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,970
Very timeless, very elegant,
definitely very chic.

883
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,090
Now, let's go check out the bedroom setup.

884
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,290
Coming back here, we have the door,

885
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,630
and this is where we
have the bedroom itself.

886
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,860
Bed set up on the left,

887
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,820
perfectly positioned towards the views.

888
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,760
I mean, we have the city
sparkling right in front of us.

889
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,320
It's gorgeous out here.

890
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,980
Hardwood floors, king size
bed, nice padded back wall,

891
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,470
with chevron pattern.

892
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,720
And coming here, right
in front of your bed.

893
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,310
We have the seating area,
another recessed back column,

894
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,440
that way sliding glass
doors open up to corner.

895
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,120
And again, the ceiling heights, the scale,

896
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,100
the space is just almost unexplainable.

897
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,540
Now, over this side,
we have more built ins.

898
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,710
This could easily serve as your office

899
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,400
for your bedroom or another seating area.

900
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,640
And stepping outside,

901
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,720
we have this private balcony
floating above the first floor,

902
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,990
and this is where have your
private all glass pool.

903
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,460
This is incredible.

904
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,090
I mean, the amount of money
spent on this pool alone.

905
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,450
I don't even wanna think about it.

906
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,040
You have a cold plunge on the other side

907
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,380
with a water feature, beautiful,

908
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,700
beautiful primary bedroom suite.

909
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,830
Now, that wraps our tour on this level.

910
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,530
I wanna take everybody upstairs

911
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,380
so we can check out the rooftop deck.

912
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:43,196
(dance music)

913
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,310
Now, we're on the rooftop deck,

914
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,380
and the first area I wanna take everyone

915
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,790
is the putting green.

916
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,720
For sure this is the coolest
putting green in the city.

917
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,490
I mean, look at these views.

918
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,040
Granted, it's been a long day.

919
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,130
We're running little late,
so as we are touring,

920
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,770
it's literally almost night right now.

921
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,110
But we're still showing it to you guys.

922
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,510
- [Mikey] There was a lot
of house to shoot guys,

923
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,260
so give us a break.

924
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,580
We had to start Enes's part a little later

925
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,413
than we usually do.

926
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,260
- Exactly,

927
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,610
but again, you guys are
getting the full experience.

928
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,340
Amazing putting green,
city is lighting up.

929
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,870
Also, before we leave this section,

930
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,730
I wanna mention behind the property,

931
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,450
we have a gorgeous detached guest home

932
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,950
with three bedrooms, four bathrooms,

933
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,640
amazing living room area.

934
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,820
Walls of glass facing breathtaking views

935
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,950
of the Pacific Ocean, has a
really nice infinity edge pool.

936
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,520
Unfortunately, since we are
running a little bit late here,

937
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,370
we're not gonna get a
chance to go down there,

938
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,030
but I'm sure our team got
some amazing shots of it.

939
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,290
So I wanted to mention that.

940
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,480
Now, continuing here, we
have the sky deck continue,

941
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,980
Epay decking on the floors,

942
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,570
multiple bar areas and
outdoor dining areas.

943
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,340
You have your fire pit here,
and like we mentioned earlier,

944
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,370
they're still putting some of

945
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,170
the finishing touches on this estate.

946
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,710
Now, coming to this section,

947
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,730
more outdoor seating areas

948
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,070
and the views are just
phenomenal, scale is incredible.

949
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,570
Lounging chairs, outdoor seating areas,

950
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,460
these gazebos, and again, the views.

951
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,540
Can we take everybody
all the way to the edge.

952
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,930
Getty and Pacific Ocean on the right.

953
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,630
Downtown Los Angeles on the left

954
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,850
Century City, Wiltshire
Corridor right in front of us.

955
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,200
This is without a doubt,

956
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,570
one of the best properties and best views

957
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,270
we have ever seen on this channel.

958
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:27,812
(dance music)

959
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:05,180
All right, everyone,
that's it for The One.

960
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,960
This was the most requested
home tour on our channel.
