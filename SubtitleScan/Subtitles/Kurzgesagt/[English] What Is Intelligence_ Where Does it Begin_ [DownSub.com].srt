1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,580
Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators to poetry to Pokemon.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,900
All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly:

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,880
Intelligence.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,900
We think of intelligence as a trait like height or strength,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,940
but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,760
In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,240
Especially the problem of staying alive, which involves finding food and shelter,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,740
fighting sexual competitors, or fleeing from predators.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,300
Intelligence is not a single thing;

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,040
it includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn, be creative, form strategies, or engage in critical thinking.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,600
It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,240
From hardwired or instinct like reactions to different degrees of learning, to some sort of awareness.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,720
But not all scientists agree where it begins or what even should count as intelligence.

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,760
To make this even more complicated,

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,480
intelligence is also connected to consciousness since awareness is helpful for problem-solving.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,700
But we're exploring consciousness in other videos, so today we'll leave it aside.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,960
Okay,

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,760
Intelligence isn't exactly clear-cut, so maybe we can think of it as more like a flexible set of skills:

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,780
A toolbox.

20
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,520
Basic tools.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,800
The most basic tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information, to save it, and to use it to learn.

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,120
Information about the world is gathered through senses such as vision, sound, smell, touch or taste,

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,820
and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,020
But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies, monitoring things like hunger and fatigue.

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,660


26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,360
Information is the basis of action for all living things,

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,340
and without it, you're at the mercy of your surroundings, unable to react appropriately, or flexibly.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,200
Information is much more powerful if we can keep and save it, so the second tool is memory.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,860
Memory is the ability to save and recall information,

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,820
so a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives something relevant.

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,340
Memories can be about events, places, and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
Some of these, like flying, have to be repeated over and over until they're mastered.

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,780
This is what we call learning, the process of putting together a sequence of thoughts or actions.

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,600
Basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted.

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,600
These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in surprisingly intelligent ways.

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,640
The acellular slime mold, which is basically just a single huge slimy cell,

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,760
shows behavior similar to an animal with a simple brain.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,420
When put in a maze with food at one end,

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,200
the slime mold explores its surroundings, and marks its path with slime trails,

40
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,360
sort of, smearing memories on the ground.

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,800
As it continues exploring, it avoids the marked pathways and finds its way to the food.

42
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,220
Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead-ends, the slime mold adapts its behavior to save time and effort.

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,740
This behavior is hardwired, and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent, although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,720
although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,280
Bees are an example of more adaptive smart behavior.

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a goal post for a sugar reward.

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,820
Not only were the bees very skillful at this behaviour, which isn't natural to them,

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,700
they got more efficient over time.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,360
When several balls were available, bees chose the ball that lay closest to the goal,

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,600
even if it was a different color than the ball they were trained with.

51
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,680
For more challenging problems, we need even more flexibility:

52
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,460
Fancier tools.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Building on the basic tools, more complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve.

54
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,100
They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections, and mechanical tricks.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,560
We'll call this tool “The Library of Knowledge”.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,140
Take raccoons. Their favorite kind of food is human food.

57
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,220
Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of theoretical and practical skills,

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,880
that makes them master burglars, able to open windows or pick locks.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,320
In a study, raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of locks,

60
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,100
like latches, bolts, plugs, or push bars.

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,360
They needed less than 10 attempts to figure out how to open each box.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,840
Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult combinations that had to be solved in the right order,

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,980
and with different amounts of strength.

64
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,940
A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes,

65
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,069
and were as fast as when they had first solved the puzzle.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,940
Beyond our library of associations and skills, the most impressive tool in our box is creativity,

67
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,720
a sort of mental duct tape.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,060
Being creative means producing something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things.

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,480
In the context of intelligence this means making new and unusual connections.

70
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,320
Pairing input with memories and skills, to come up with a unique solution to a problem.

71
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,240
In another raccoon study, researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank,

72
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,100
they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the top.

73
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,600
One raccoon came up with a much better solution: it tipped the tub over.

74
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,260
Another facet of creativity is applying a new resource to a task:

75
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,540
Physical tools.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,060
Like primates that use sticks to fish for termites in trees, or some octopuses,

77
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,020
which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable armor to hide from enemies.

78
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:00,500
Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced dimension of problem-solving:

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,140
Planning.

80
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,600
Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and putting them together in a plan.

81
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,240
When unforeseen circumstances and new possibilities present themselves,

82
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,640
they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not.

83
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,980
An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later.

84
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,020
This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,480
But even though hiding food comes instinctively to them,

86
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,440
they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions.

87
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,440
Squirrels examine every nut and weigh the time and effort it would take to hide it,

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,500
against the benefits they would get from each one.

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,300
Damaged or low-fat nuts are eaten right away, while nuts that still need to ripen go on the stockpile.

90
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,180


91
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,280
Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched.

92
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,820
These empty caches distract rivals from their real treasure.

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,940
This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone else,

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,980
you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same things.

95
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,360
The more complex the problem, the more tools are needed in combination to solve it.

96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,160
So the more tools there are, the more flexibility a being has to solve the challenges life throws at them.

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,020
But even for complex problems, each animal's individual situation is what counts.

98
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,280
Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely.

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,420
For them, it makes sense to remember where there's food in different locations

100
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,540
and trick their enemies to improve their chances of survival.

101
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,060
Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve, but they don't need to.

102
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,600
They are grazers and live in flocks.

103
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,220
The skills relevant to them are social.

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,760
They recognize and remember many different sheep, and even humans for years; a completely different skill.

105
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,460
Evolving and retaining a complex set of mental abilities they might never use would be a waste of resources for them.

106
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,120
Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence toolkit.

107
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,140
While this was helpful, by accident we added another set of tools on top:

108
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,200
Culture.

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,960
No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator.

110
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,780
But thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across generations,

111
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,140
we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability.

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,440
This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking.

113
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,740
We also created new problems in the process: sudoku, tax forms, string theory.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,960
But also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance.

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,340
To solve these, we'll need to look past short-term survival and think about the distant future.

116
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,340
We have the toolbox, we just need to use it.

117
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,480
Speaking of tools for learning, we've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class.

118
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,500
So we asked what would help them the most and made an education edition for teachers, students, and everyone else.

119
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,100
They're slightly larger posters about various things that we'll expand over time.

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,880
From a periodic table, to a world map or the human body.

121
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,260
You can get them in our shop and support us if you want.

122
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,420
And let us know which poster topics you want for your room or classroom.

123
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,040
This video was part two of a three-part video series relating to big questions of life and the universe,

124
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,020
made possible thanks to a grant from the Templeton World charity foundation.

125
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,800
You'll find our sources and further reading in the video description.
