00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,680
In 2023 Kurzgesagt has existed for 10 years, 
insanely long in internet years. We are among the  

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,540
largest sciency channels on Youtube and still a 
bit of a black box to people. So let us talk about  

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,380
ourselves a bit in three parts: Our backstory, how 
we finance our work and the values of Kurzgesagt!

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,260
Let’s jump to a more innocent time.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,020
From humble beginnings to Today

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,140
Kurzgesagt’s foundation was laid when Philipp, our 
founder, dropped out of high school as a teenager.  

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,980
Learning seemed daft and useless and he was not interested in anything. Until a very special teacher at a school for dropouts grabbed him  by the neck. The way she taught was different.   

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,960


9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,020
She talked about connections and the big picture. 
She told a story. For the first time ever,  

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,580
Philipp wanted to learn more without being 
forced. It was a key life experience.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,500
Kurzgesagt tries to recreate this 
experience for you. Nothing is  

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,740
boring if you tell a good story 
and we try to tell these stories,  

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,160
to spark excitement and make you 
want to go on and learn more.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,120
Because of the one teacher that could do 
this, Philipp got a high school degree,  

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,500
studied history and design and eventually 
started Kurzgesagt as a passion project,  

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,780
inspired by Crash Course World history.

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,840
In 2012 Youtube was less commercial and more 
idealistic. You couldn’t make a living with  

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,360
videos as involved as ours and that was fine. 
The goal was creative freedom and so for the  

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,160
first few years, it actually cost money to 
make Kurzgesagt. We had no outside funding,  

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,620
just intrinsic motivation and a few friends from 
university. We worked for clients during the day  

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,820
and on Kurzgesagt at night, 80-100 hours a week. 
It was a real struggle but also very rewarding.

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,100
But then Patreon launched, sponsorships 
started, our views increased, Youtube  

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,140
changed. In 2015 the channel began to 
break even and then to earn a profit.  

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,760
But we were pretty burned out at this 
point, so we decided to bring in more  

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,960
friends and hire the first team members 
full time, creating a legal entity.

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,620
More people meant that we could stop overworking, 
do more and improve. But we also needed to earn  

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,020
more; the livelihood of real humans depended 
upon it. None of us had any experience in  

28
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,640
running a company. We didn’t plan to become 
big or to grow – it sorta just happened.

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,900
A decade later Kurzgesagt is 
not a small project anymore. 

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,960
We are an animation studio, with offices 
in Munich and Berlin. We need computers,  

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,380
monitors, tablets, desks, coffee, contracts, 
pay licences, taxes, rent and insurance.

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,520
In 2023 our team consists of over 60 full 
employees and a lot of freelancers around  

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,800
the world. Salaries alone cost millions 
of dollars a year, just to stay around.

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,960
This creates an interesting problem: 
with such high production costs, 

35
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,360
how can we publish our work for free?

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
How we finance Kurzgesagt

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,560
We have added up our earnings from 2015 through 
2022. Our sources of funding change depending on  

38
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,600
opportunities and the state of the world. Early 
on, agency work was our main source of income,  

39
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,180
ad revenue varies, in some years we got 
more sponsorships than in others. The shop  

40
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,260
didn’t exist for a long time, then it became 
pretty big after we launched our calendar.

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,600
62% of our revenue comes 
indirectly or directly from you:  

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,460
You watch our videos with ads, support 
us on Patreon or buy from our shop.

43
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,720
The single biggest source of income by far, is 
our shop that alone accounted for 40% over the  

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,360
last 8 years. The shop started small but once we 
published our calendar for the first time in 2016,  

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,980
we realised it could really help us do more 
things and we started producing more and  

46
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,900
more science products, from our posters to our 
gratitude journal or universe scented candles.  

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:03,180
YouTube ads accounted for 13% and Patreon 9%. 
So without your support we would cease to exist.

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,180
Our shop and Patreon are our most important 
sources of revenue, and because we see ourselves  

49
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,100
as science communicators – we don’t just do 
merch, but sciency products that we spend  

50
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,899
hundreds of hours researching, discussing with 
experts, polishing up and working on directly  

51
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,500
with the manufacturers. They are part of the 
science story we try to tell. It also just feels  

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,180
good to get directly funded by you guys and give 
you something back for it, on top of our videos.  

53
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,280
YouTube ads are a crucial part of our funding 
as well, but they are not within our control.

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,700
Then there is paid agency work, which we 
stopped doing in 2022 – it accounted for  

55
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,980
9% of our revenue over the last 8 years. A 
lot in the beginning, not much by the end.

56
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,080
Then there are commercial sponsors 
advertising products -they accounted  

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,460
for 12% of our revenue. We also 
got about 7% from German Public  

58
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,540
Broadcasting for the German Channel, 
but ended this partnership in 2022.

59
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,540
Finally there are institutional sponsors 
representing about 10%. Some people take  

60
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,980
issue with this – especially Bill Gates has come 
under public scrutiny, and we’ve been criticised  

61
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,440
for even working with organisations funded by 
him. So let us look at this 10% in more detail:

62
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,940
About 3% of our revenue over the 
last eight years came from the Gates  

63
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,900
organisations for a wide variety 
of topics, often suggested by us.

64
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,800
5% comes from Open Philanthropy and is only 
used for specific projects. With these funds,  

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,680
we have started Arabic, Hindi, Korean, Japanese, 
Portuguese, and French channels, bringing more  

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,320
free science content to more people. Then there is 
a two-year funding for original Tik Tok content,  

67
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,580
which gives us freedom to explore and learn 
how to do short form science communication.

68
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,820
The final 2% came from other organisations 
like the red cross or the UN for example.

69
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,380
We choose institutional sponsors 
carefully but if organisations  

70
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,100
want to fund videos that help us spread 
quality information about relevant topics,  

71
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,200
this is an easy yes for us, if we have 
the capacity for it. On top of that,  

72
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,920
the institutional sponsors we are 
working with align with our values.

73
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,740
We have contracts with every grant giver or 
sponsor that bars them from editorial influence,  

74
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,700
other than suggesting topic areas like 
“global health” or “climate change”.  

75
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,220
We agree on video topics together, but 
sponsors can neither influence details, nor  

76
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,700
our conclusions. The final decision always remains 
with us. And usually, we develop the topics of the  

77
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,140
videos autonomously and tell the sponsor what 
we are doing afterwards. If you are interested  

78
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,580
in how we research our videos in detail, our 
head of research wrote an article about it.

79
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Running an educational youtube channel is a 
balancing act that we take very seriously. We  

80
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,400
are doing our best to maintain this balance, 
adjusting whenever necessary. As a team and  

81
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,960
company we want to grow to give more people 
access to a science based outlook on the world.

82
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,160
This brings us to our final topic 
– why are we doing Kurzgesagt?

83
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,760
Our Values and Our Vision

84
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,660
Our core mission is to spark curiosity. We 
want to make science and humanism accessible  

85
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,760
for as many people as possible. The effort 
we put into creating our videos is a way of  

86
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,040
achieving that – our videos are beautiful 
because that helps to spark curiosity,  

87
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,480
to understand complex topics, and because 
it just feels good to create and watch.

88
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,120
Our research is as intensive as it is 
so our videos are a good simplification  

89
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,160
of very complicated topics. We want 
to make people excited about science  

90
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,960
so they rediscover subjects they hated 
in school and see how amazing they are.

91
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,140
On top of curiosity, we want to inspire long term 
thinking and a positive, constructive outlook.  

92
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,860
Being optimistic about the future of humanity 
is not mainstream and we think this is horrible.  

93
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,720
Pessimism often sounds smart and 
gets more views while optimism can  

94
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,380
sound naive but this is a bias that 
is not helpful for us as a species.  

95
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,020
So despite the gloominess of many topics, 
we want to approach them with informed and  

96
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,580
well researched optimism – not brushing 
humanity's very real challenges aside,  

97
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,160
but also not falling into the trap of pessimism. 
We want to inspire you to dream a little about  

98
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,200
the glorious future that we could actually 
build – but only if we believe it is possible.

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,800
In the long run we don’t only want to do this 
on Youtube. The idea is for Kurzgesagt to be a  

100
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,840
positive influence across more media. On our 
Tik Tok channel, in the long form content we  

101
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,000
are exploring, in apps, in the VR game that will 
be released later this year and the games we plan  

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to make in the future. Our shop is a central part 
of this vision: we start our stories with a video  

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,980
and end them with a pos
ter.

104
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,920
There are so many things we want to do. And 
thanks to you watching this right now, we have  

105
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,900
the freedom to work to the best of our knowledge 
and ability. In the end, we hope you like what  

106
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,300
we offer and that we will be doing something 
worthwhile for as long as we exist. And hopefully,  

107
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,300
we’ll have a lasting impact by making science and 
learning more fun for as many people as possible.

108
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,120
If you personally want to help us do this, you can 
watch and share our videos, check out our shop,  

109
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,640
become a patreon or give us an ad blocker 
exception. We exist because of you and  

110
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,040
you have no idea how much we appreciate that 
you are here. And hopefully we are less of a  

111
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,100
black box now. In any case. Doing Kurzgesagt 
for a decade has been a pretty crazy ride.  

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,040
So from the whole team – Thank you so 
much for being with us all these years.
